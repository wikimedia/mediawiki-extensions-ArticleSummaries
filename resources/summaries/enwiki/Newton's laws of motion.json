	"summary": "## Newton's Laws of Motion\n\nNewton's three laws of motion explain how objects move and the forces that act on them. They were first written by Sir Isaac Newton in 1687. These laws are the foundation of classical mechanics.\n\nWhile they work well for most everyday situations, they don't explain everything. For example, they don't work well for objects moving very fast, very massive objects, or tiny particles like atoms.  Scientists developed new theories like relativity and quantum mechanics to explain these situations.",
