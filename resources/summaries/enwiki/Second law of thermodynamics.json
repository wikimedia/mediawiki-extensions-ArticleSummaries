	"summary": "This law is all about how heat and energy move and change. It says that heat always moves from hot to cold things, like when you touch a hot stove, the heat travels to your hand. Also, it tells us that not all heat can be turned into useful work.\n\nThe law introduces the idea of 'entropy,' which is like a measure of disorder. It explains that natural processes always lead to more disorder or entropy. For example, a broken cup won't fix itself because that would go against the second law, as it would mean less entropy.",
