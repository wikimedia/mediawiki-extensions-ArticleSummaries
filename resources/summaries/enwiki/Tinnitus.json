	"summary": "Tinnitus is when you hear sounds like ringing or buzzing in your ears, even when it's quiet. Most people experience a little bit of this, but it's only a problem if it's loud and bothersome. It can be linked to hearing loss, ear infections, or even stress and depression.\n\nDoctors diagnose it by listening to your symptoms and doing hearing tests. They might also use scans to check for any issues in your ears or brain. Managing tinnitus often involves learning ways to cope with the noise and reducing stress. Sometimes, hearing aids can help.",
