	"summary": "An **antihero** is a main character in a story who isn't your typical hero. They might do good things, but their reasons aren't always pure. Think of them as morally gray. They might even have some bad traits. Clint Eastwood's \"Man with No Name\" in old Western movies is a good example. Some scholars say an antihero is doomed to fail and blames others, but others think they're just heroes or villains depending on the perspective. Usually, antiheroes are at the center of conflict, driven by their own desires, not necessarily to help others.",
