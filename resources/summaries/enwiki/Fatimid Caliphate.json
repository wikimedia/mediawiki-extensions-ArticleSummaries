It was led by a dynasty that claimed to be descendants of Prophet Muhammad's daughter, Fatima. They started in North Africa, conquering Tunisia and then spreading to other regions like Egypt, Sicily, and parts of the Middle East. At its peak, the caliphate was a cultural and religious center, but it faced challenges like civil wars and invasions. Eventually, it was ended by Saladin in 1171, who started the Ayyubid dynasty.",
