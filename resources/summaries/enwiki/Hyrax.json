	"summary": "Hyraxes are small, round mammals that live in Africa and some parts of the Middle East. They have fluffy fur, short tails, and look a bit like large pikas. These herbivores are related to elephants and sea cows. Hyraxes can live up to 14 years and usually weigh between 4 and 11 pounds. Some ancient hyrax species were much bigger, with one possibly weighing as much as a rhinoceros.",
