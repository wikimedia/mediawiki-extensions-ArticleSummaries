	"summary": "Zebras are African animals known for their unique black-and-white striped coats. There are three types: Grévy's zebra, plains zebra, and mountain zebra. They are related to horses and donkeys. Zebra stripes help protect them from biting flies. Zebras live in different habitats, from savannas to mountains. They mainly eat grass and are preyed upon by lions. Some zebras live in small family groups, while others live alone or in larger herds. Grévy's zebras are endangered, while the other two species are at risk but not yet extinct. Zebras are popular in art and stories, but they can't be fully domesticated like horses.",
