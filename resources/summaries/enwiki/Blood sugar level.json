	"summary": "Blood sugar levels naturally go up and down throughout the day, depending on what we eat. Our bodies keep these levels balanced, storing extra sugar in muscles and the liver. Glucose, the sugar in our blood, is crucial for energy, especially for our brains.\n\nHigh blood sugar (hyperglycemia) can be a problem, leading to diabetes. Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) is also harmful.  Diabetes is a common condition where blood sugar stays too high. Factors like alcohol and some medicines can also affect blood sugar levels.",
