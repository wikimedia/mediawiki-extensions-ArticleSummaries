These animals were huge, with bulls reaching up to 7 feet tall at the shoulder. They had long, curved horns that could grow up to 3 feet. Aurochs were once found in Asia, Europe, and North Africa but became extinct around the 17th century due to hunting and habitat loss.\n\nAncient people often depicted aurochs in art, showing their importance in various cultures. They were seen as symbols of strength and power. Over time, aurochs were domesticated, leading to the different types of cattle we have today.",
