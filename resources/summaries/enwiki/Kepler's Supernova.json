	"summary": "SN 1604, also known as Kepler's Supernova, was a bright and powerful explosion of a star in our galaxy. It happened in 1604 and was seen by many people on Earth without the need for telescopes. This supernova was special because it was the last one in our galaxy that we know of, happening only 20,000 light-years away from us. Johannes Kepler, an astronomer, wrote about this event, and that's why it has his name.",
