	"summary": "The Russo-Ukrainian War began in 2014, but escalated significantly on February 24, 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine, causing a massive conflict and Europe's worst refugee crisis since World War II. Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed the invasion was to support breakaway republics in Ukraine, but it led to widespread international condemnation and allegations of war crimes and genocide. Russian troops faced logistical challenges and strong Ukrainian resistance, retreating from the capital Kyiv by April 2022. Ukraine launched successful counteroffensives and retaken territory, while Russia illegally annexed occupied areas. The war caused a global food crisis and extensive environmental damage, with the ICC investigating potential crimes against humanity.",
