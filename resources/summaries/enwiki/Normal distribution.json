	"summary": "A normal distribution, also known as a Gaussian distribution, is a type of continuous probability distribution. It's often used to describe random variables that can take on any real value. The mean (average) and variance (how spread out the data is) are important parameters. The shape of this distribution is like a bell curve, where most of the data is in the middle and gets less common as you move away from the mean. This type of distribution is very common in nature and science because of a rule called the central limit theorem.",
