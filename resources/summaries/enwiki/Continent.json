	"summary": "A continent is a large geographical region, and there are seven commonly recognized ones: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. The number can vary depending on how they're grouped. For example, some might combine North and South America into one continent called America. Oceania, which includes Australia and many Pacific islands, is sometimes considered an eighth continent. Continents can be one big landmass like Asia or made up of smaller connected landmasses like Europe and Asia. The idea of continents moving apart, called continental drift, came from the ancient supercontinent Pangaea.",
