	"summary": "The Commodore 64 is an iconic home computer released in 1982. It's one of the best-selling computers ever, with estimates of 12.5 to 17 million units sold. The C64 had 64 kilobytes of memory and advanced graphics and sound capabilities for its time. It was very popular in the 1980s, especially in the US, where it outsold other computers. Despite competition, it remained successful in the UK. However, it didn't do well in Japan and France. The C64's success is attributed to its affordable price and availability in regular stores. It had a huge library of software and games, and its influence can still be seen today in retro computing and the demoscene.",
