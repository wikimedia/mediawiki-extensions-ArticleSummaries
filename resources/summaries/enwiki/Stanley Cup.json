	"summary": "The Stanley Cup is the coolest trophy in North American sports, given to the best hockey team every year. It's named after Lord Stanley, a Canadian leader, who wanted to support amateur hockey. The first Cup was given in 1893, and it became the NHL's big prize in 1926.\n\nIt's made of silver and is huge! Teams get to keep it for a bit, and their names are engraved on it, but not everyone fits. So, every 13 years, a new band is added to keep track of the winners. It's super old, and lots of teams have won it, even some that don't exist anymore. The Florida Panthers are the current champions!",
