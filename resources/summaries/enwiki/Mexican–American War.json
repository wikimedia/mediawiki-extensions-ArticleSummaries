	"summary": "The Mexican–American War (1846–1848) started due to a dispute over the border between Texas (recently annexed by the U.S.) and Mexico. The U.S. wanted to buy Mexican territory, including California, but Mexico refused. After U.S. soldiers entered the disputed area, Mexico attacked, leading to war.\n\nU.S. forces quickly took control of New Mexico and California, and after invading Mexico City, Mexico agreed to peace. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848) gave the U.S. Texas, California, and other western territories. Mexico lost a large part of its land and suffered many casualties. This war had long-lasting effects on both countries, intensifying debates over slavery in the U.S. and causing political turmoil in Mexico.",
