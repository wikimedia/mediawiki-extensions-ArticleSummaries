	"summary": "The Geneva Conventions are international rules to make wars fairer and less cruel. They were first written in 1864 and updated in 1949 after World War II. These rules protect people who aren't fighting, like civilians and prisoners of war. They say how people should be treated during wars, including helping the wounded and sick, and protecting those who aren't fighting. Almost all countries have agreed to follow these rules.",
