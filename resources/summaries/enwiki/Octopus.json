	"summary": "An octopus is a sea creature with eight arms and a soft body. They are part of the cephalopod family, which includes squids and cuttlefish. Octopuses have excellent vision and are very smart. They can change their body shape to fit through small spaces and use a siphon to swim and breathe.\n\nThese creatures live in different ocean areas, from coral reefs to deep waters. They have a unique way of reproducing, and males often die after mating. Octopuses protect themselves with ink, camouflage, and quick movements. While all octopuses are venomous, only some are dangerous to humans.\n\nOctopuses are often featured in myths and stories, like the Kraken, and are considered a delicacy in many cultures.",
