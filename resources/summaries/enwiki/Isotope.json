	"summary": "Hydrogen has three natural isotopes: protium, deuterium, and tritium. Isotopes are atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons. Hydrogen isotopes all have one proton, but vary in neutrons: protium has none, deuterium has one, and tritium has two.\n\nThe term 'isotope' comes from Greek words meaning \"equal place,\" as isotopes of an element have the same position on the periodic table but different masses due to varying neutron counts. Each isotope has a unique mass number, which is the total number of protons and neutrons in its nucleus.",
