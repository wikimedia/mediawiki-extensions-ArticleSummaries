	"summary": "Insects are the largest group of animals, with over a million species. They have a hard outer skeleton, six legs, and a body divided into three parts. Insects breathe through holes in their sides and have a simple circulatory system. They usually reproduce by laying eggs and go through stages of growth, often changing appearance. Some insects fly, swim, or walk on water. Many live in social colonies, like bees and ants. Humans sometimes consider insects pests, but they are also important for pollination, as food, and for making products like silk and honey.",
