	"summary": "Volleyball is a team sport played by two teams of six players separated by a net. Each team tries to score points by hitting the ball onto the other team's court. It has been in the Summer Olympics since 1964, with beach volleyball added in 1996. The game starts with a serve, and teams can touch the ball up to three times to return it. The aim is to attack and make the ball hard to return, winning points. Players use their hands and arms, and sometimes other body parts, to hit the ball. Techniques like spiking, blocking, passing, and setting are key to the game.",
