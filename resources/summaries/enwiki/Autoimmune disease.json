There are over 80 known autoimmune diseases, and they can affect almost any body part. Symptoms vary but often include fever, fatigue, and feeling unwell. Some specific symptoms are joint pain, skin rashes, or problems with the nervous system.\n\nThe causes aren't fully understood, but both genes and the environment play a role. Common autoimmune diseases include celiac disease, type 1 diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis. Treatment focuses on managing symptoms and calming the immune system with medicines. Many people need long-term care. About 10% of people in the UK have an autoimmune disease, and women are more often affected.",
