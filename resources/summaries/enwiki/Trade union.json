	"summary": "Trade unions, or labor unions, are groups of workers who come together to make their jobs better. They aim to get higher pay, improve working conditions, and keep workers safe. Unions also help with problems at work and make sure rules are fair. Members pay a small fee, called union dues, to fund the union's work. Elected leaders negotiate with employers on behalf of all members.\n\nUnions can be for specific jobs, like construction, or for many different types of workers. They started in the UK during the Industrial Revolution and are now found worldwide.",
