	"summary": "Joshua was a biblical figure who served as Moses' helper and later became the leader of the Israelites after Moses' death. Originally named Hoshea, Moses renamed him Joshua, meaning \"Yahweh is salvation.\" He was one of the twelve spies sent to Canaan and later led the Israelites into the Promised Land, dividing it among the tribes. Joshua is respected in both Jewish and Islamic traditions, with Muslims believing he was Moses' companion and a leader of the faithful. He is said to have lived during the Bronze Age and died at 110 years old.",
