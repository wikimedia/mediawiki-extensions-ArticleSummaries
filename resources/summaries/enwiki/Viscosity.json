	"summary": "Viscosity describes how \"thick\" or resistant a fluid is to flowing. It's like comparing syrup, which is slow and thick, to water, which flows quickly. Scientists measure it using force, time, and area. Viscosity is crucial when fluids move; it creates friction between layers, especially in tubes. This friction needs a force to overcome it, and this force is linked to the fluid's viscosity. Temperature and pressure can change a fluid's viscosity. Some fluids, called Newtonian, keep a constant viscosity, while others can change over time.",
