	"summary": "The glans is the sensitive tip of the penis, often called the \"head.\" It's smooth, glossy, and covered by a fold of skin called the foreskin in uncircumcised males. The glans sits over the corpora cavernosa and is part of the corpus spongiosum. It has a small opening for urine and is connected to the frenulum, a stretchy band of tissue. During development, it forms from the genital tubercle, which is present in all embryos and becomes the penis in males due to androgen hormones.",
