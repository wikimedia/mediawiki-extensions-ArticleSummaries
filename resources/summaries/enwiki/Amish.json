	"summary": "The Amish are a religious group with Swiss roots. They believe in simple living, wearing plain clothes, and avoiding modern technology like cars and electricity. The Amish started in the 1600s when a leader named Jakob Ammann had a disagreement with other Mennonites. Today, there are around 400,000 Amish people, mainly in the United States and Canada. They live in close-knit communities, speak their own language (Pennsylvania Dutch), and have their own schools. Amish people are known for their peaceful ways and strong faith.",
