	"summary": "Montana is a big state in the western part of the United States, known for its mountains and wide-open spaces. It's one of the least crowded states, with most people living in cities like Billings. The western side has lots of mountains, while the east is mostly prairies.\n\nPeople from the United States started settling here after the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. Gold was discovered later, leading to a gold rush and more settlers. Montana became a state in 1889, and mining was its main business for a long time. Now, it's known for farming, mining, and tourism, with many people visiting its beautiful landscapes.",
