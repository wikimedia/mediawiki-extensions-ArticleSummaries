	"summary": "Alexander McQueen's 2008 fashion collection was inspired by British culture and fairy tales. It told the story of a wild girl who lived in a tree and became a princess. The show had two parts: black-and-white outfits for her tree-dwelling life, and colorful, fancy dresses for her royal transformation. It was well-liked by critics and is now considered one of McQueen's best works. Some designs, like the peacock headpiece, are famous and shown in museums.",
