	"summary": "A satellite is a spacecraft that orbits a planet, like Earth. They help us in many ways: communicating over long distances, predicting weather, navigating with GPS, and even spying for military purposes. Most satellites get power from the sun using solar panels. They communicate with ground stations using transponders.\n\nSatellites are launched into space by rockets and can adjust their orbit using thrusters. Most are in low Earth orbit or geostationary orbit, staying in one spot over the planet. As of 2022, there are over 6,700 satellites orbiting Earth, with the US having the most.",
