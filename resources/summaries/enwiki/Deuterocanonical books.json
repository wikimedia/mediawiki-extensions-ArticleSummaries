	"summary": "## Deuterocanonical Books\n\nDeuterocanonical books are extra books found in the Old Testament of Catholic and Orthodox Bibles, but not in Jewish or Protestant Bibles. These books, like *Tobit* and *Judith*, were written between 300 BC and 100 AD and are part of the Septuagint, an ancient Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible. Early Christian leaders often quoted from them.  The Catholic Church officially declared them canonical in the 4th century.",
