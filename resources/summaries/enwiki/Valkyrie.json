	"summary": "Valkyries are powerful female figures in Norse mythology. They choose the bravest warriors who have died in battle and guide them to Valhalla, Odin's great hall. There, these warriors, called einherjar, prepare for the final battle, Ragnarok. Valkyries serve them mead and are sometimes shown with swords, shields, or horns. They are often depicted receiving warriors, like in the Lilbj√§rs III stone. These images are found in ancient texts, poems, and even on picture stones. The name 'valkyrie' means 'chooser of the slain.'",
