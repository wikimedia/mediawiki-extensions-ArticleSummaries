	"summary": "Hemorrhoids, also called piles, are swollen blood vessels in the rectum or anus. They can be internal (inside) or external (outside). Internal hemorrhoids may cause bright red bleeding during bowel movements, while external ones can cause pain and swelling around the anus.\n\nCauses include increased pressure in the abdomen from constipation, diarrhea, or sitting too long. They're common during pregnancy. Treatment often starts with lifestyle changes like eating more fiber and staying hydrated. Creams can help with pain, but their effectiveness is not proven. Serious cases might need procedures or surgery.\n\nHemorrhoids are common, affecting about half the population at some point.",
