	"summary": "Albatrosses are large seabirds found mostly in the Southern Ocean and North Pacific. They have huge wingspans, up to 11.5 feet, and are excellent flyers, using special techniques to glide effortlessly. These birds eat squid, fish, and krill. They live and breed on remote islands, often in large groups. Albatrosses mate for life, performing special dances to find their partners.\n\nThere are about 22 albatross species, and many are in trouble due to threats like pollution, overfishing, and getting caught in fishing lines. People are working to protect these birds and their habitats.",
