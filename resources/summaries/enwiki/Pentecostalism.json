	"summary": "Pentecostalism is a Protestant Christian movement that started in the early 20th century. It focuses on a personal experience with God, called the \"baptism of the Holy Spirit,\" which often includes speaking in tongues. This movement began with an idea that the end times were near and God would restore spiritual gifts to the church. Charles Parham and William Seymour were key leaders in its early growth.\n\nPentecostals believe in the Bible's teachings and the power of spiritual gifts. They are known for their vibrant worship and global reach, especially in the Global South. The movement has grown to include many denominations and has influenced other Christian traditions.",
