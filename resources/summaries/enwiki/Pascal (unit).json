	"summary": "The pascal (Pa) is the SI unit for pressure, named after Blaise Pascal. It's defined as one newton per square meter (N/mÂ²). Pascals are used to measure various types of pressure, stress, and strength. Common multiples include hectopascals (hPa) and kilopascals (kPa).\n\nIn weather reports, atmospheric pressure is often given in hectopascals, with 1013 hPa being the typical pressure at sea level. Different countries use different units; the US uses inches of mercury or millibars, while Canada uses kilopascals.",
