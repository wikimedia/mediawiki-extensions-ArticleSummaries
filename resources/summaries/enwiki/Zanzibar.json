	"summary": "Zanzibar is a semi-autonomous region of Tanzania, made up of many small islands and two big ones: Unguja (the main island) and Pemba. It became part of Tanzania in 1964. Zanzibar City, with its historic Stone Town, is the capital. The economy relies on spices (like cloves and nutmeg), raffia, and tourism, which has grown a lot since the 1980s. The islands are known for their beautiful marine life and unique animals like the Zanzibar red colobus monkey. However, environmental issues, including climate change, are causing concerns.",
