	"summary": "The Chinese zodiac is a 12-year cycle where each year is represented by an animal and its traits. It's an important part of Chinese culture and is also popular in many East Asian countries. Unlike the Western zodiac, which is based on star signs, the Chinese version uses animals to predict personality and future events. The 12 animals include the rat, ox, tiger, and dragon. Some people believe these animals influence a person's life, from career to relationships. The zodiac year starts on Chinese New Year or the Start of Spring, according to different beliefs.",
