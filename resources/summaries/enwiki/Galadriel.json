In the Second Age, she rules Lothl√≥rien with her husband, Celeborn. Tolkien calls her the mightiest elf in Middle-earth. Scholars say she represents Tolkien's idea of ancient English elves, like angels in old stories. She's often compared to other powerful female figures in literature. In movies, Cate Blanchett and Morfydd Clark have played her.",
