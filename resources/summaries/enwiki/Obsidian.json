	"summary": "Obsidian is a unique volcanic rock that forms when lava cools quickly. It's like a natural glass, created when hot, silica-rich lava hardens without forming crystals. This process gives obsidian its smooth, shiny appearance and sharp edges.\n\nFound near volcanoes, obsidian was useful to ancient people for making tools and weapons due to its hardness and the sharp edges it creates when broken. Even modern scientists have used it for surgical blades!",
