	"summary": "The Reformation was a big change in Christianity in the 1500s. It started when Martin Luther, a German priest, wrote the *Ninety-five Theses* in 1517, questioning the Catholic Church's teachings. This led to the creation of a new branch of Christianity called Protestantism.\n\nLuther and other reformers believed that people could be saved by faith in Jesus alone, not by good deeds. The printing press helped spread their ideas quickly. The Catholic Church responded with the Counter-Reformation, trying to fix its problems. This time marked a big shift in European history, ending the Middle Ages.",
