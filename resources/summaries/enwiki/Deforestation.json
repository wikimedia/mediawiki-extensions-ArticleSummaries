	"summary": "Deforestation is when forests are destroyed and turned into farms, ranches, or cities. It's a big problem, with about 18 million hectares of forest lost each year. This is like losing a forest the size of Bangladesh annually!\n\nThe main cause is agriculture, with farmers clearing land for crops and livestock. Other reasons include logging, mining, and urban growth. Deforestation hurts the environment by destroying habitats, threatening wildlife, and contributing to climate change. It also reduces the forest's ability to absorb carbon dioxide, which is crucial for our planet's health.",
