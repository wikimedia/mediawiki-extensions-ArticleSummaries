	"summary": "The Compact Disc, created by Philips and Sony, revolutionized digital audio storage. It stores up to 74 minutes of audio or 650 MB of data on a 120mm disc. Introduced in 1982, CDs became hugely popular in the 1990s, surpassing vinyl records and cassette tapes in sales. They were adaptable, leading to formats like CD-ROM for computers and Video CD. By 2000, CDs dominated the music market, but their reign ended with the rise of MP3s and digital downloads in the mid-2000s.",
