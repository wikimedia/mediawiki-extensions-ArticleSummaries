	"summary": "Europa is a moon of Jupiter, discovered by Simon Marius and Galileo Galilei. It's small but the sixth largest in the solar system. Europa has a smooth, young surface with few craters, made of ice and rock. Scientists believe it has an ocean under the surface, which might hold life, maybe single-celled organisms. The Hubble Space Telescope found water vapor plumes, hinting at this underground ocean.\n\nSpace probes have studied Europa since the 1970s, with more missions planned, like NASA's Europa Clipper. No spacecraft has landed on it yet, but these missions will help us learn more about this fascinating moon.",
