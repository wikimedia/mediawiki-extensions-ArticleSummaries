	"summary": "OCD is a mental health condition where people have unwanted, intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and feel the need to do repetitive actions (compulsions) to make those thoughts go away. For example, someone might obsessively worry about germs and then compulsively wash their hands many times to feel clean. These rituals can take up a lot of time and make daily life hard. OCD can start in childhood or young adulthood and affects about 1 in 40 adults and 1 in 100 children in the U.S. It can be treated with therapy and medicine.",
