It contains parts of these bacteria, either dead or weakened, to teach your body to fight them. This vaccine is very safe as it doesn't have any live germs.\n\nIn the past, the US used the DPT vaccine, but now they use DTaP, which has a different type of pertussis component. Both are important to prevent these diseases.",
