	"summary": "Cirrhosis is a serious liver condition where healthy tissue is replaced with scar tissue. This happens due to long-term liver damage, often from alcohol or certain diseases. Early signs are tiredness and weight loss. As it gets worse, it can cause skin itching, swelling, and yellow skin (jaundice).\n\nIt can lead to serious problems like liver failure, bleeding in the stomach, and cancer. Common causes include drinking too much alcohol, hepatitis B and C, and being overweight. Doctors use tests and sometimes a liver biopsy to diagnose it. While there's no cure, treating the cause can slow it down. In severe cases, a liver transplant might be needed.",
