	"summary": "The 24-hour clock is a way of telling time from midnight (00:00) to the next midnight (23:59). It's used more often worldwide than the 12-hour clock and is the international standard. Some countries, especially English-speaking ones, still use the 12-hour clock or a mix of both. Professions like medicine prefer the 24-hour clock to avoid confusion about time in important records.",
