	"summary": "Salamanders are unique amphibians with lizard-like features. They have slender bodies, short limbs, and tails, and belong to the order Urodela. These creatures are mostly found in North America's Appalachian Mountains and the Holarctic region. Salamanders have a special ability to regrow lost limbs and even vital organs, making them an essential subject for medical research.\n\nSome species lay eggs in water, while others reproduce while still in the larval stage. Interestingly, certain salamanders have toxic skin, using bright colors to warn predators. With their amazing regenerative powers, salamanders offer valuable insights for treating human injuries and illnesses.",
