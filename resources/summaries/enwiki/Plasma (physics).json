	"summary": "Plasma is a type of matter, like solids, liquids, and gases. It's unique because it has lots of charged particles, like ions and electrons. Plasma is super common in the universe, found in stars and between galaxies. We can make it on Earth by heating gases or using strong magnetic fields. Plasma is used in many things we see every day, like plasma TVs. It can also be partly made of neutral particles, like in neon signs and lightning.",
