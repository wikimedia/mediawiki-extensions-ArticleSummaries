	"summary": "Rhodesia, now known as Zimbabwe, was an unrecognised state in Africa from 1965 to 1979. It was originally a British colony, but declared independence in 1965 due to fears of black majority rule. This led to a war known as the Rhodesian Bush War.\n\nThe country was named after Cecil Rhodes, a British businessman who explored and controlled the region in the late 19th century. After the war, Rhodesia reverted to British rule briefly before gaining international recognition as Zimbabwe in 1980. Its capital, Salisbury, is now called Harare.",
