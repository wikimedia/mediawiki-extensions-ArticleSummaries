	"summary": "Petroleum, a yellowish-black liquid found underground, is made mostly of hydrocarbons. It's used for many things after being refined, like fuels (gasoline, diesel), asphalt, and materials to make plastics, textiles, and medicines. We get it through oil drilling, which involves studying the earth's structure. There are also unconventional sources like oil sands. However, using petroleum hurts the environment, releasing greenhouse gases and causing pollution. It's a major cause of climate change. Despite this, petroleum has been very important for the world's economy and development.",
