	"summary": "\"Jaws\" is a 1975 thriller film directed by Steven Spielberg, based on Peter Benchley's novel. It stars Roy Scheider as Chief Brody, who teams up with a biologist and a shark hunter to catch a great white shark terrorizing a beach town. The film was groundbreaking for being shot mostly in the ocean, though production was challenging. Spielberg used a minimalist approach, suggesting the shark's presence with an ominous theme by composer John Williams. Released in over 450 theaters, \"Jaws\" was a huge success, becoming the highest-grossing film until \"Star Wars\" and influencing modern Hollywood's focus on summer blockbusters. It's now preserved in the U.S. National Film Registry.",
