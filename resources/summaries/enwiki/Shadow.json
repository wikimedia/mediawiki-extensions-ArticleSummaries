	"summary": "A shadow is a dark shape or outline that appears when an object blocks light. It's like a reverse image of the object creating it. Shadows can be seen when light shines on an object, and they can change shape and size depending on the object's position. For example, a musician's shadow on a wall might look like a distorted figure due to the shape of the wall. Shadows can also be created by natural light blockers like clouds, or even by uneven surfaces like snow.",
