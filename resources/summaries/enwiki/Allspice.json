	"summary": "Allspice, sometimes called Jamaica pepper or pimento, comes from the dried berries of the Pimenta dioica tree. This tree is originally from the Greater Antilles, Mexico, and Central America, but is now grown in many warm places worldwide. The English named it \"allspice\" in 1621 because it tastes like a mix of cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove. Despite its name, it's not a blend of spices. Other plants with \"allspice\" in their name, like Carolina allspice and Japanese allspice, are not related.",
