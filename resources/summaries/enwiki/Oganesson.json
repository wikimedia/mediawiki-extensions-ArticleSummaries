	"summary": "Oganesson (symbol Og) is a synthetic element with atomic number 118, discovered in 2002 by Russian and American scientists. It was officially recognized in 2015 and named after nuclear physicist Yuri Oganessian in 2016. Oganesson has the highest atomic number and mass of all known elements. It's a p-block element in the periodic table, belonging to group 18. Its only known isotope, Og-294, is highly radioactive with a very short half-life. Due to its rarity and radioactivity, its chemical properties are still unknown. Theory suggests it might be a solid at room temperature and more reactive than other noble gases.",
