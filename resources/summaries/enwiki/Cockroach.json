	"summary": "Cockroaches, or roaches, are ancient insects from the Blattodea order, with over 4,600 species. Only about 30 species are linked to human habitats and some are known pests. Originating 320 million years ago, they're highly adaptable, surviving in extreme climates. Modern roaches are diverse, with some having complex social structures. Despite their reputation as dirty pests, most are small, harmless, and live in various global habitats. Termites are also part of the Blattodea order.",
