The aim is to score runs by hitting a ball with a bat and running between two sets of wickets. Players can also get opponents 'out' by hitting the wickets with the ball or catching the hit ball before it bounces.\n\nThe sport originated in England in the 16th century and spread worldwide with the British Empire. Today, it is most popular in South Asia, Australia, and the UK. There are different formats, from traditional five-day Test matches to the faster-paced Twenty20.",
