	"summary": "Pneumonia is when your lungs get inflamed, mostly in the tiny air sacs. It can make you cough, have chest pain, fever, and trouble breathing. Sometimes it's hard to tell what's causing it, but usually, it's viruses or bacteria. Doctors might use X-rays and tests to figure it out.\n\nYou're more likely to get pneumonia if you have certain health problems or a weak immune system. Vaccines and good hand hygiene can help prevent it. Treatment depends on the cause; antibiotics help with bacterial pneumonia. It's a serious illness, but many people get better, especially with the right treatment.",
