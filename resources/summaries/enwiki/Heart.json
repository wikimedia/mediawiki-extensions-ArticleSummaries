	"summary": "The heart is a muscle that pumps blood around the body. It's part of the circulatory system, which includes blood vessels. Blood carries oxygen and nutrients to tissues and removes waste. In humans, the heart is about the size of a fist and has four chambers. It's located between the lungs.\n\nThe heart beats in a rhythm controlled by electrical signals. Deoxygenated blood enters the right side, goes to the lungs for oxygen, then returns to the left side to be pumped to the body. Exercise can improve heart health, but cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death globally.",
