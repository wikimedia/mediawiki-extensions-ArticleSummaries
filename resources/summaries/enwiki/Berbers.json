	"summary": "Berbers, also known as Amazigh, are diverse ethnic groups native to North Africa. They speak various Berber languages and have a rich history dating back to Ancient Egypt. Once organized into kingdoms like Numidia and Mauretania, they were later influenced by Arab conquests, leading to cultural changes and the spread of Islam.\n\nDespite historical divisions, a modern movement, Berberism, aims to unite Berbers and promote their cultural identity. Many prefer the term \"Amazigh\" over \"Berber,\" which was assigned by outsiders. Today, Berbers primarily live in Morocco, Algeria, Libya, and neighboring countries.",
