	"summary": "A covalent bond is when atoms share electrons to become stable. This is common in organic chemistry. For example, in hydrogen gas (H2), two hydrogen atoms share two electrons. Covalent bonds can happen between different elements if they have similar electronegativity, which is how they attract and share electrons. These bonds are strong and help atoms have full valence shells, making them stable. The term \"covalent\" means the atoms share their valence, or outer, electrons.",
