	"summary": "Conscription is when a government requires people, usually young men, to join the military. It has a long history, dating back to ancient times. Many European countries used it in peacetime, with men serving active duty and then moving to reserves.\n\nThis practice is controversial. People may object due to religious beliefs, political views, gender inequality, or individual rights. Some may avoid service by leaving their country. Alternatives exist, like community service in Austria and Switzerland.\n\nToday, many countries don't use conscription, preferring volunteer armies. However, some still have the power to reinstate it during wars or crises. Democracies are less likely to use conscription than autocracies.",
