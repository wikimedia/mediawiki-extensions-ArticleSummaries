	"summary": "Jacob, later named Israel, is a significant figure in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. He is introduced in the Book of Genesis as the son of Isaac and Rebecca, and twin brother to Esau. Jacob bought Esau's birthright and tricked his father into blessing him. He had twelve sons, who became the founders of the Twelve Tribes of Israel, and a daughter, Dinah. Jacob's favoritism caused family tension, leading to Joseph being sold into slavery.\n\nScholars debate Jacob's historical existence, with no archaeological evidence found. Some believe the narratives are literary compositions rather than historical records.",
