	"summary": "Neanderthals were ancient humans who lived in Eurasia until around 40,000 years ago. They were first discovered in Germany's Neander Valley. Scientists aren't sure when Neanderthals and modern humans split, but it was likely between 315,000 and 800,000 years ago.\n\nThese ancient people had advanced technology, including stone tools, fire-making skills, and even simple clothes. They were skilled hunters and gatherers, eating a variety of foods. Neanderthals had a robust build and were adapted to cold climates.\n\nRecent studies show that Neanderthals and modern humans interbred, with about 20% of Neanderthal genes still present in modern Eurasians. Despite their extinction, Neanderthals continue to fascinate us and provide insights into our human history.",
