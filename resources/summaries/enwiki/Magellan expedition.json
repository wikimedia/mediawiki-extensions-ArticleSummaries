They sailed across the Atlantic and discovered a strait, now named after Magellan, which led them to the vast Pacific Ocean. After many struggles, including Magellan's death in the Philippines, the remaining crew, led by Juan Sebasti√°n Elcano, completed the journey. They returned to Spain in 1522, becoming the first to circumnavigate the Earth. This trip showed the world's true size and opened new sea routes.",
