	"summary": "The German Confederation was a group of 39 German-speaking countries in Central Europe. It was formed after the Holy Roman Empire ended due to the Napoleonic Wars. The Confederation had one main group, the Federal Convention, where member states' representatives met. Austria led these meetings, but it had no real leader.\n\nWhile it was a strong alliance with federal law being more important than state law, it was also weak due to its structure. Unanimity was needed for big decisions, and it only dealt with security. Austria and Prussia, the largest states, often disagreed.\n\nAfter the 1848 revolutions failed to create a unified Germany, the Confederation ended after Prussia won a war against Austria in 1866. This led to the formation of the North German Confederation, a step towards a united Germany.",
