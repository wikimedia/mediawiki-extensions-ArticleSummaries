	"summary": "In 2015, the United Nations created 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to achieve \"peace and prosperity for people and the planet\" by 2030. These goals include ending poverty, protecting the environment, and ensuring everyone has access to quality education and healthcare. Though ambitious, recent reports suggest many goals won't be met due to challenges like climate change and rising inequalities. The COVID-19 pandemic also set back progress, especially in Asia. Achieving the SDGs requires global cooperation, more funding, and prioritizing environmental sustainability. So far, the SDGs have mainly influenced discussions but haven't led to major policy changes.",
