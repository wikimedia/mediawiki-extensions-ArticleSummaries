	"summary": "Science is divided into three main groups: natural science, social science, and formal science. These are the foundation for all scientific study. From these, we get more specific fields like engineering and medicine, known as applied sciences.\n\nEach branch has its own expertise and language but often borrows from others. For example, medicine uses knowledge from biology, chemistry, and physics. All scientific knowledge must be based on real observations and be able to be tested and proven by other scientists.",
