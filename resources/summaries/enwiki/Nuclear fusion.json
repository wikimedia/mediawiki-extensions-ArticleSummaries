	"summary": "Nuclear fusion is when tiny atomic nuclei join together to make bigger ones. This happens in stars like our sun. It releases a lot of energy, which is how stars shine. The nuclei used are usually hydrogen isotopes. When they fuse, they create helium and give off energy. Lighter elements like hydrogen and helium are easy to fuse, but heavier ones need more energy. In a supernova, there's enough power to make even heavy elements like iron.",
