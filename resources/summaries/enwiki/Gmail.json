Gmail launched with 1GB storage, much more than competitors at the time, and now provides 15GB for free. Users can buy more storage through Google One.\n\nGmail has a unique interface, showing emails in conversations, and was the first to use Ajax technology. It automatically scans emails for spam, malware, and once, for ads, which caused privacy concerns. Google now uses data from other services for ads instead.",
