	"summary": "Centipedes are predatory arthropods with many legs, belonging to the class Chilopoda. They have one pair of legs per body segment and are venomous, using pincer-like appendages called forcipules to inject venom. Despite their name, centipedes don't have 100 legs; they have between 15 to 191 pairs of legs. These creatures live in various habitats, from rainforests to deserts, but need moist environments as they lose water quickly. Centipedes are mostly nocturnal and hunt a variety of prey.",
