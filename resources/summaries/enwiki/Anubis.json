	"summary": "Anubis, the ancient Egyptian god, was like a guardian angel for people who died. He was often shown as a jackal or a man with a jackal's head, watching over graves. His main job was to guide souls to the afterlife and make sure they were judged fairly. \n\nHe was really important in ancient Egypt, helping with burial rituals and protecting tombs. Even though he was super popular, there aren't many stories about him. Anubis was also linked to his brother, Wepwawet, and had a daughter, Kebechet, who was a snake goddess.",
