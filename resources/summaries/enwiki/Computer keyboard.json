	"summary": "A computer keyboard is a device that lets you type information into a computer. It looks like a typewriter keyboard with many keys. Each key has letters, numbers, or symbols on it. When you press a key, the computer understands what you want to write. You can also use special keys to tell the computer to do certain things, like the \"escape\" key for system commands. Since the 1970s, keyboards have been the main way to enter data into computers, often used with a mouse. Touchscreen devices use virtual keyboards.",
