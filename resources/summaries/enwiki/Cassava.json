	"summary": "Cassava is a tropical shrub, originally from South America, grown for its starchy root. It's a crucial food source, especially in tropical regions, as it's drought-resistant and can grow in poor soil. People eat it boiled or use it to make tapioca (cassava starch), which is used in food and industry. \n\nThere are sweet and bitter varieties. Bitter cassava has more toxins, so proper preparation is essential to avoid poisoning. Despite this, it's sometimes used as emergency food during droughts. Nigeria is the biggest producer, and Thailand leads in exporting cassava starch.",
