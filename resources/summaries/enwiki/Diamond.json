	"summary": "Diamonds are super-hard and super-hot stones made of carbon. They form deep inside Earth and are brought to the surface by volcanoes. Most diamonds are ancient, between 1 and 3.5 billion years old.  Some countries are known for producing lots of diamonds, like Russia, Botswana, and Canada. Scientists can also make diamonds in labs.  It's hard to tell the difference between real, lab-made, and fake diamonds, but special tests can help.",
