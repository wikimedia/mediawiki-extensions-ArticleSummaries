	"summary": "The kelvin (K) is the SI base unit for temperature. It starts at absolute zero (0 K), the lowest temperature possible. The Kelvin scale is directly related to the Celsius scale; adding 273.15 to a Celsius temperature gives you the equivalent in kelvins. For example, 0Â°C is 273.15 K.\n\nLord Kelvin created this scale in the 19th century. It was officially adopted into the SI system in 1954. Recently, in 2019, the definition was updated to relate kelvins to energy using the Boltzmann constant.",
