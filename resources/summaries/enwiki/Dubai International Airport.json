	"summary": "Dubai International Airport (DXB) is the busiest airport in the world for international passengers. Located in the Al Garhoud district, it serves as the main hub for Emirates Airline and flydubai. The airport is huge, covering 7,200 acres, and Terminal 3 is one of the largest buildings globally. In 2023, it handled 87 million passengers and lots of cargo. DXB is very busy with flights, having the most Airbus A380 and Boeing 777 movements. It's also a big job creator and contributes significantly to Dubai's economy. However, it will likely close once Al Maktoum Airport finishes its expansion.",
