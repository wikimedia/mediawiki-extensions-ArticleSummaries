	"summary": "Loch Ness is a large, deep lake in the Scottish Highlands, famous for the legendary Loch Ness Monster, or \"Nessie.\" It's 23 miles long and very deep, with poor visibility due to peat in the soil. The lake connects to other water bodies, like Loch Oich and Loch Dochfour, through rivers and canals. Loch Ness holds more water than all the lakes in England and Wales combined, making it the largest body of water in the Great Glen. It has an artificial island, Cherry Island, and several villages nearby, including Drumnadrochit, which has a center dedicated to the Loch Ness Monster.",
