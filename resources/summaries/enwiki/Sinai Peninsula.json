	"summary": "The Sinai Peninsula is a bridge-like piece of land in Egypt, connecting Asia and Africa. It's about 60,000 square kilometers and home to around 600,000 people. The area is divided into two main parts: South and North Sinai. It's named after Mount Sinai, a place of great importance in the Bible.\n\nSinai has been part of Egypt for over 5,000 years. It was invaded a few times, including by Israel in the 1950s and 1960s. After a peace treaty in 1979, Israel returned most of Sinai to Egypt. Today, it's a popular tourist spot for its nature, coral reefs, and religious history.",
