	"summary": "Chemical elements are substances that cannot be broken down further. They are made of atoms with the same number of protons. Elements can combine to form molecules and compounds. The periodic table organizes all the elements by their atomic number. This helps scientists understand how elements behave and react. There are 118 known elements, with 94 found naturally, and the rest made in labs. The periodic table is a useful tool for chemists to study and predict element behavior.",
