	"summary": "Prokaryotes are single-celled organisms with no nucleus or membrane-bound organelles. The term comes from Greek, meaning \"before nut.\" They evolved before eukaryotes and are divided into two groups: Bacteria and Archaea. Prokaryotes lack complex structures like nuclei and mitochondria. Some form colonies or have multicellular life stages. They reproduce asexually through binary fission.\n\nProkaryotes are important in understanding life's evolution, especially with their diverse types, like extremophiles, found in harsh environments.",
