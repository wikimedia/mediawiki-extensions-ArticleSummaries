	"summary": "Caffeine is a natural stimulant found in coffee, tea, and many plants. It helps people stay awake and improves their focus. Caffeine works by blocking a brain chemical called adenosine, which makes you feel tired. This blockage boosts energy and sharpens thinking.\n\nIt is safe to consume in small amounts, like in a few cups of coffee. However, too much caffeine can cause headaches and sleep problems. Pregnant women are advised to limit their intake. Caffeine is legal and widely used worldwide, making it the most popular psychoactive substance.",
