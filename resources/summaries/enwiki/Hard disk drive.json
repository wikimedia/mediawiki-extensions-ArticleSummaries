	"summary": "A hard disk drive (HDD) is a device that stores digital data using magnetic storage. It has spinning platters with magnetic heads that read and write data. HDDs are used in computers and servers for storage. They were first made by IBM in 1956.\n\nHDDs are being replaced by faster and smaller solid-state drives (SSDs) in some devices, like phones and laptops. However, HDDs are still popular for large servers and storage. The size and speed of an HDD are important features, with 3.5-inch drives common in desktops and 2.5-inch in laptops.",
