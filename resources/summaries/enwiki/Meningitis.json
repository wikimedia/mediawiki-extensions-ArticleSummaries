	"summary": "Meningitis is swelling of the membranes around your brain and spinal cord. It can be serious and needs medical help right away. Symptoms include fever, bad headache, vomiting, stiff neck, and sometimes sensitivity to light. Young kids might just seem cranky or tired.\n\nIt can be caused by infections (viruses, bacteria, fungi) or other things like cancer or certain drugs. Doctors use a test where they take fluid from your spine to figure out the cause.\n\nVaccines can help prevent some types, and quick treatment with antibiotics or antiviral drugs is important. Without treatment, it can lead to serious problems like hearing loss or seizures.",
