	"summary": "The Hanging Gardens of Babylon were one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. They were described as beautiful, tiered gardens with many plants, built like a big, green mountain. Legend says King Nebuchadnezzar II built them for his wife, who missed her homeland's green hills. Some believe they were in Babylon, Iraq, while others think they might have been in Nineveh, or that they're just a myth. No one has found clear proof of their location yet.",
