	"summary": "Death is when living things stop working forever. It happens to all living organisms, usually from getting old, diseases, or accidents. The human skull is often used as a symbol to represent death.\n\nWhen someone dies, their body stops working, and it usually starts to break down. Doctors can sometimes bring people back to life if they stop breathing, but brain death is also a sign of death. Many cultures believe in life after death and have special rituals to honor the dead.\n\nAs of 2022, around 110 billion humans have died, mostly from heart problems. Scientists are studying ways to help people live longer.",
