	"summary": "Cognitive dissonance is when your thoughts and actions don't match up, causing mental stress. For example, if you believe something but your actions go against it, you might feel uncomfortable. To fix this, people might change their thoughts or actions to make them align. Leon Festinger studied this and found that people try to reduce this discomfort by rationalizing their behavior, believing in a fair world, or only paying attention to information that supports their views. They might even avoid situations that could cause more conflict.",
