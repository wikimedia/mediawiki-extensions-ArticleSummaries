	"summary": "St. Peter's Basilica is a huge, famous church in Vatican City, Rome. It was built in the 1500s to replace an old church from the 300s. Many famous artists, like Michelangelo, helped design it. The basilica is very important to Catholics because it's believed to be where Saint Peter, one of Jesus' apostles, is buried. Popes and other important church leaders are often buried there too. Although it's not the official church of the Pope, it's still one of the holiest places in Christianity.",
