It claimed that people who spoke a certain old language were a special race, called Aryans, and were more noble. But scientists agree this is not true.\n\nSome people used this idea to say white people were better, which led to racist beliefs and terrible events like the Holocaust. This shows why it's important to question ideas and not judge people based on their race or history.",
