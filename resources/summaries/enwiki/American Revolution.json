	"summary": "The American Revolution was a fight for freedom by the 13 British colonies in America. They wanted to rule themselves instead of being controlled by Britain. The colonies were angry about new taxes and rules, so they formed a congress and created the Continental Army. After years of fighting, with help from France and Spain, the colonies won their independence in 1783. This led to the formation of the United States of America, the first country governed by its people with a set of laws.",
