	"summary": "The Holodomor was a devastating famine in Ukraine from 1932 to 1933, causing millions of deaths. It was part of a larger Soviet famine, but Ukraine, a major grain producer, suffered the most due to high grain quotas. Historians debate if it was a deliberate genocide by Joseph Stalin to crush Ukrainian independence or a result of Soviet industrialization and agricultural policies.\n\nMany countries now recognize the Holodomor as a genocide, but early estimates of the death toll vary. Ukraine and other nations have acknowledged this tragedy, and its impact is still felt today.",
