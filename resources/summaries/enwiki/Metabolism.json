It involves chemical reactions, helped by enzymes, that keep cells working, allow us to grow, and respond to our surroundings.\n\nThese reactions can build things up (anabolic) or break things down (catabolic).  Think of building proteins or breaking down sugar for energy.\n\nAmazingly, many of these processes are similar in creatures as different as bacteria and elephants, showing how important and ancient they are.",
