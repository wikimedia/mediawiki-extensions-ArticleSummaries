A piece of foam damaged the shuttle's wing during launch, allowing hot gases to enter and destroy the internal structure. This was the second fatal accident in the Space Shuttle program, after the Challenger disaster in 1986.\n\nAfter the accident, NASA made changes to improve safety, including on-orbit inspections and rescue missions. Space Shuttle flights were suspended for over two years, and the focus shifted to the International Space Station.",
