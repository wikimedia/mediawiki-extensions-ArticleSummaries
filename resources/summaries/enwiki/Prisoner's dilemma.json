	"summary": "The prisoner's dilemma is a game where two people must choose between working together or betraying each other. If they both cooperate, they get the best result. However, if one betrays while the other cooperates, the betrayer gets an even better outcome. The dilemma is that while betraying might seem like the best choice for an individual, it often leads to a worse result for both. This game shows how cooperation can be hard even when it's beneficial, and it's used to understand many real-life situations.",
