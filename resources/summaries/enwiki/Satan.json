	"summary": "Satan, or the Devil, is a powerful figure in Abrahamic religions. He tempts people to do wrong and is often seen as a fallen angel who rebelled against God. In Judaism, Satan is a metaphor for evil desires. In Christianity, he is linked to the serpent in the Garden of Eden and is shown as a red dragon in the Book of Revelation. Over time, Satan's role has changed, from a minor figure in medieval times to a central figure in later beliefs, including witchcraft and demonic possession. His appearance is not described in the Bible but is often depicted with horns and a tail in art.",
