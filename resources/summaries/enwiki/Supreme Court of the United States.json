	"summary": "The Supreme Court is the highest court in the United States. It has the final say on federal and constitutional laws. The court has nine judges, called justices, who are appointed by the President and approved by the Senate. They make decisions on important cases and can declare laws or presidential actions unconstitutional. These justices work in Washington, D.C., and they stay in their roles for life unless they choose to leave or are removed. The court receives thousands of requests for reviews but only accepts a small number each year.",
