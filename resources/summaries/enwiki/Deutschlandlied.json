	"summary": "The \"Deutschlandlied\" is Germany's national anthem, officially called \"Das Lied der Deutschen.\" It has been used since 1922, except for a short period after World War II when West Germany had a different anthem. Only the third stanza is used now because the first two are linked to the Nazi regime. The music was composed by Joseph Haydn in 1797, and the lyrics were written by August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben in 1841, promoting German unity. The phrase \"Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit\" from the third stanza is Germany's unofficial motto.",
