	"summary": "Jews are an ethnoreligious group originating from the ancient Israelites. Their traditional religion is Judaism, but not all Jews practice it. The Jewish people have a rich history, dating back to the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. Over time, they spread worldwide, forming the Jewish diaspora. This diaspora includes three main groups: Ashkenazim (Central/Eastern Europe), Sephardim (Iberian Peninsula), and Mizrahim (Middle East/North Africa). \n\nJews have made significant contributions to various fields, including science, philosophy, literature, and religion. They have also played a crucial role in shaping Western culture, as they wrote the Bible and influenced the development of Christianity and Islam.",
