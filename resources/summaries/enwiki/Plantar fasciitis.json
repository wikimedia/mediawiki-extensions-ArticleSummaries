You might feel the most pain when you take your first steps in the morning or after resting.\n\nOveruse, standing for too long, exercise changes, and obesity can bring it on. Tight Achilles tendons and flat feet are also linked to it.\n\nMost people recover with rest, painkillers, and stretching. Sometimes, special insoles, physical therapy, or steroid injections help. In rare cases, doctors might suggest shockwave therapy or surgery. It's a common issue, affecting many people at some point in their lives.",
