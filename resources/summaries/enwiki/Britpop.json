	"summary": "Britpop was a music movement in the mid-1990s in Britain. It celebrated British culture and music, reacting against the darker sounds of grunge and shoegaze. Britpop brought colorful, catchy rock into the mainstream, inspired by 1960s pop, 1970s glam and punk, and 1980s indie.\n\nBig bands like Oasis, Blur, Suede, and Pulp led the movement, which peaked in 1995-1996. A famous chart battle between Blur and Oasis, called \"The Battle of Britpop,\" made headlines. The movement also influenced fashion, art, and even politics.\n\nBy the late 1990s, Britpop started to fade, with bands changing styles or breaking up. It evolved into a new indie movement, with bands like Travis and Coldplay.",
