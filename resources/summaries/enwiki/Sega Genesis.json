Designed with a powerful Motorola 68000 processor and Zilog Z80 sound controller, it plays over 900 games on cartridges. It was released in various regions with different distributors and had add-ons like the Power Base Converter.\n\nThough less successful in Japan, the Genesis thrived in North America, Brazil, and Europe, thanks to popular games like Sonic the Hedgehog and aggressive marketing. It sold over 33 million units worldwide. Its success sparked a \"console war\" with Nintendo's Super Nintendo. The Genesis was eventually succeeded by the Sega Saturn in 1994.",
