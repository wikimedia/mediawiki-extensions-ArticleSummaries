	"summary": "Cheese is a tasty food made from milk. It comes in many flavors and textures, like soft Brie or hard Parmesan. To make cheese, milk is curdled using bacteria or rennet, then the solid parts (curds) are separated from the liquid (whey) and pressed. Some cheeses have special molds on the outside.\n\nThere are over 1000 types worldwide, each unique due to the milk source, production methods, and aging. Cheese is popular because it's nutritious, portable, and lasts a long time. It's often flavored with herbs, spices, or even smoke!",
