	"summary": "Theodor Herzl started the Zionist movement in the late 1800s, dreaming of a Jewish state. Zionism wanted Jews to have their own land, free from European persecution. They chose Palestine, an area important in Jewish history.\n\nAt first, they considered other places, but settled on Palestine, which was then part of the Ottoman Empire. This led to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The goal was to create a Jewish majority in Palestine, and after Israel's independence in 1948, Zionism became its national ideology.\n\nZionism has different groups with varying views, but all support a Jewish homeland in Palestine. Some see it as a return to their ancient home, while others criticize it as colonialist.",
