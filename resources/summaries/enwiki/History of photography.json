	"summary": "## Photography's Journey: From Early Experiments to Everyday Snapshots\n\nPhotography began with the \"camera obscura,\" a dark room projecting images. Early experiments used light-sensitive materials, but images weren't permanent. In 1826, Nicéphore Niépce created the first fixed camera image, but it took a long time to capture. Louis Daguerre improved this with the daguerreotype, a clear, detailed process announced in 1839.\n\nOver time, photography got faster and easier. New materials reduced exposure time, and roll films made it popular. Digital cameras revolutionized photography in the 1990s, making it accessible to everyone. Now, with smartphones, we can take and share photos instantly.",
