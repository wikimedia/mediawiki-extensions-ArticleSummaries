These cats are very relaxed and love to be held, often going limp like a rag doll, which is how they got their name. They are large and heavy, with a unique color pattern. Ragdolls are popular pets in the UK and the US because they get along well with people and other animals. They are often called \"dog-like\" due to their loyal and friendly behavior.",
