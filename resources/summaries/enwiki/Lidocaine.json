	"summary": "Lidocaine, sold as Xylocaine, is a common anesthetic used to numb parts of the body during medical procedures. It can be applied to the skin or injected near nerves. Lidocaine also treats fast heart rhythms. It usually starts working within minutes and lasts for up to three hours. Sometimes, it's mixed with adrenaline to last longer. While generally safe, it can cause side effects like confusion and nausea if injected intravenously. Discovered in 1946, it's now a widely used generic medicine.",
