	"summary": "Ceres is a small dwarf planet found between Mars and Jupiter. It was the first asteroid ever discovered, back in 1801. Ceres is too small and far away to see with the naked eye. Scientists learned more about it when a space probe called Dawn visited it in 2015.\n\nThe surface of Ceres is made of ice and minerals. It might have a core with liquid inside, but no ocean. Ceres can have volcanic activity, but with ice instead of lava. It also has a very thin atmosphere.",
