	"summary": "## Air Quality Index (AQI) Explained\n\nThe Air Quality Index (AQI) tells us how clean or polluted the air is. It goes up when there's more pollution, like smoke from wildfires. A high AQI means the air is dangerous, especially for kids, the elderly, and people with asthma or heart problems. When the AQI is high, it's best to stay indoors and be less active. Wearing masks outside and using air purifiers inside can help during wildfire season. Different countries have their own AQI systems.",
