	"summary": "The wolverine is a powerful and fierce animal, the biggest in the weasel family. It's a strong carnivore that lives alone and can kill prey much bigger than itself. You can find wolverines in cold, northern areas, like Canada, Alaska, and Russia. They used to be common, but their numbers have dropped because of hunting and losing their homes. Now, they're mostly gone from the southern parts of their range.",
