Over centuries, the Hohenzollerns ruled, expanding Prussia's size and power. In 1871, it united German states to form the German Empire. \n\nPrussia was known for its strong army and conservative rulers, often called \"Junkers.\" After World War II, the Allies abolished Prussia in 1947, ending its role in German politics and history.",
