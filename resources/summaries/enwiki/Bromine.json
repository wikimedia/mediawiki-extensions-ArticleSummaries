	"summary": "Bromine (symbol Br) is a chemical element with atomic number 35. It's a red-brown liquid at room temperature that smells bad. Discovered in 1825-26, its name comes from the Greek word for \"stench.\" Bromine is very reactive and doesn't exist freely in nature. It's found in ocean water and extracted from brine.\n\nBromine is useful in fire retardants and can be harmful to the ozone layer. It's also important in making certain medicines and chemicals. However, too much bromine is toxic. Interestingly, some plants and animals make their own bromine compounds.",
