	"summary": "The Thirteen Colonies were British settlements in North America in the 1600s and 1700s. They were along the Atlantic coast and included New England, Middle Colonies, and Southern Colonies. Over time, the colonies grew and people from different backgrounds settled there.\n\nThe colonies had their own governments but were still controlled by Britain. They didn't like British rules and taxes, so they started working together. In 1776, they declared their independence and fought the American Revolutionary War. With help from France, they won and formed the United States of America in 1783.",
