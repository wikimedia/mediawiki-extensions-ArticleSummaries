People have lived here for a long time, with the Dardani tribe forming a kingdom around 400 BC. It was later ruled by the Romans, Byzantines, and Ottomans.\n\nIn modern times, Kosovo faced tensions between Albanians and Serbs, leading to the Kosovo War. It declared independence in 2008, which some countries recognize. Kosovo is working on its development and has joined many international groups. It's also hoping to join the European Union.",
