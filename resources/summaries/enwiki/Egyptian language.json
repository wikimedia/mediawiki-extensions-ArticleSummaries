	"summary": "Ancient Egyptian is an old language that was spoken in Egypt thousands of years ago. It's part of a group of languages called Afro-Asiatic. We know about it because many ancient texts have been found, written in hieroglyphics, which are ancient Egyptian symbols. This language is special because it's one of the oldest written languages we know of, dating back to around 3000 BC. Over time, it changed and developed into different forms, like Demotic and Coptic, but it was eventually replaced by Arabic.",
