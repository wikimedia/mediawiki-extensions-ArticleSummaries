	"summary": "Moore's Law is named after Gordon Moore, a tech pioneer. He noticed that the number of tiny parts (transistors) in computers doubled every year, making them more powerful. Later, he said this doubling would happen every two years. This prediction has mostly come true since 1975, guiding the tech industry.\n\nIt means computers get better and cheaper over time, with more memory and better cameras. However, some experts think this trend might be slowing down now, and there's a debate about when it will stop.",
