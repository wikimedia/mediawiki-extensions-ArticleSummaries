	"summary": "## Coriolis Effect Simplified\n\nThe Coriolis effect is like a trick our spinning Earth plays on moving objects. Imagine throwing a ball straight. On Earth, it seems to curve! This is because our planet's spin creates a force called the Coriolis force.\n\nThis force deflects objects to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. Think of it like a giant invisible hand pushing things sideways. This effect is important for big things like weather systems and ocean currents.",
