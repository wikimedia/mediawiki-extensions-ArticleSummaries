	"summary": "Anesthesia is a medical way to temporarily make someone feel no pain or be unconscious during a procedure. It can relax muscles, make you forget things, or even make you sleep. This is done using special medicines called anesthetics. There are three main types: general (puts you to sleep), local (numb a specific area), and regional (numb a larger area).\n\nDoctors choose the right drugs for each patient and procedure. While there are risks, they are often linked to the patient's health and the procedure's complexity. Some possible issues are nausea, vomiting, or more serious problems like heart attacks.",
