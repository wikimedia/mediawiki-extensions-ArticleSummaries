	"summary": "Gamma rays are a type of radiation that comes from the breakdown of atomic nuclei. They have very short wavelengths and high energy, making them very powerful. Gamma rays can go through almost anything, even our bodies, which is why they are dangerous. They can cause serious health problems like cancer and radiation sickness. \n\nPaul Villard discovered gamma rays in 1900. They're found in nature from things like radioactive decay and cosmic rays. We also make them in places like nuclear reactors. In the electromagnetic spectrum, gamma rays overlap with X-rays, but they come from different sources.",
