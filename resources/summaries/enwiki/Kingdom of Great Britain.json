	"summary": "The Kingdom of Great Britain was a country in Europe that existed from 1707 to 1800. It was formed when England and Scotland united, creating a new kingdom that included the whole island of Great Britain. Before this, the two countries had been ruled by the same king since 1603. The new kingdom had one parliament but kept separate laws for England and Scotland.\n\nThere were attempts to include Ireland in the union, but it remained a separate kingdom. The early years saw political unrest, with the Jacobite risings trying to restore the previous royal family. Over time, the power of the parliament grew, and the role of prime minister was established. The country became a major global power, with victories in wars and the growth of its empire.",
