	"summary": "## The Mystery of the Princes in the Tower\n\nIn 1483, King Edward IV of England died, leaving his two young sons, Edward V and Richard, as heirs to the throne. Their uncle, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, took them to the Tower of London, but they were never seen in public again.\n\nMost people believe the princes were murdered, maybe by their uncle Richard, to become king. Others think they might have escaped. No one knows for sure what happened, but their disappearance remains one of England's greatest mysteries. Some even claim that people later seen alive were actually one of the princes.",
