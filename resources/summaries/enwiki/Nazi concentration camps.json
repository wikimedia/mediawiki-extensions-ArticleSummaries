	"summary": "During the rule of Adolf Hitler, Nazi Germany built over 1,000 concentration camps between 1933 and 1945. These camps were used to hold prisoners, first mainly German communists, but later also criminals, those considered \"asocial,\" and Jews. As World War II progressed, people from occupied countries were also imprisoned.\n\nAbout 1.65 million people were held in these camps, and around a million died there. Many fatalities occurred towards the war's end. After Allied victories, the camps were liberated, but many prisoners died on forced marches. Today, museums at former camp sites remember the victims.",
