	"summary": "Punk rock is a music genre that started in the 1970s. It's fast, loud, and often has short songs with strong melodies. Punk bands usually play with a 'do-it-yourself' attitude, making their own recordings and releasing them independently. The lyrics often talk about standing up against authority.\n\nThe style was influenced by earlier rock and garage bands. It began in places like New York and London, with bands like the Ramones and the Sex Pistols. Punk rock also created a unique fashion style, featuring leather jackets, spikes, and offensive T-shirts. Over time, it evolved into different subgenres and influenced many other music styles.",
