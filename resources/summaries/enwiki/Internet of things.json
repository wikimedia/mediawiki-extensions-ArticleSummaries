	"summary": "The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to physical objects like devices and appliances with built-in sensors and software, enabling them to connect and exchange data over networks. These 'smart' objects don't necessarily need the public internet but can communicate within private networks. IoT combines various technologies, making everyday items more efficient and controllable. For example, smart homes use IoT for remote control of lights, thermostats, and security systems via smartphones.\n\nWhile IoT offers many benefits, there are concerns about privacy and security due to these devices' interconnectedness. This has led to efforts to establish standards and regulations to protect users' data and privacy.",
