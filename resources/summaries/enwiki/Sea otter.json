	"summary": "Sea otters are marine mammals found in the North Pacific Ocean. They are small but heavy for their size, with thick fur, which keeps them warm in the ocean. These otters dive to the sea floor to eat sea urchins, mollusks, and fish. Interestingly, they use rocks as tools to open shells.\n\nOnce hunted for their fur, sea otters were close to extinction. Now, thanks to protection and conservation efforts, their numbers have increased, but they are still considered endangered. They play a crucial role in the ocean ecosystem by controlling sea urchin populations.",
