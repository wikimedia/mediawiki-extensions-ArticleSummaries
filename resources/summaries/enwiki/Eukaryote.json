	"summary": "Eukaryotes are a group of organisms with cells that have a special structure called a nucleus. This includes animals, plants, and fungi. They are different from prokaryotes, like bacteria, as they are bigger and have more complex cells. Eukaryotes likely evolved from ancient archaea and bacteria through a process called symbiogenesis.\n\nThese organisms can be single-celled or made up of many cells. They reproduce in different ways, including mitosis (splitting cells) and meiosis (creating gametes for sexual reproduction). Eukaryotes play a vital role in Earth's ecosystems due to their large size and abundance.",
