	"summary": "Bumblebees are a type of bee found mostly in the Northern Hemisphere. There are over 250 species, each with a fuzzy, round body and colorful stripes as a warning to predators. Most live in small colonies with a queen, but some, called cuckoo bumblebees, are parasitic and take over other bees' nests.\n\nThey feed on nectar and pollen, using their long tongues. Bumblebees are important for agriculture as pollinators, but their numbers are decreasing due to habitat loss and pesticides.",
