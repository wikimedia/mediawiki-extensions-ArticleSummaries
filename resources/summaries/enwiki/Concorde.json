	"summary": "Concorde was a special airplane made by France and the United Kingdom. It could fly very fast, more than twice the speed of sound! It had a unique design with a pointy nose and triangle-shaped wings. Only 20 were made, and they were used by Air France and British Airways. These planes could fly from London to New York in just a few hours. But, because of a crash in 2000 and high costs, they were retired in 2003. Now, many people remember Concorde as an amazing piece of history, and some are even on display for everyone to see.",
