	"summary": "**Simplified Summary: Floods**\n\nA flood happens when too much water covers land that's usually dry, like streets or fields. This can happen when rivers overflow, rain falls heavily, or the sea rises. Human activities, like cutting down forests, can make floods worse. Climate change also causes bigger and more frequent floods. Floods can damage homes, spread diseases, and force people to move. They happen in places like Morpeth, England, and can be caused by different things, such as rain, snowmelt, or rivers overflowing.",
