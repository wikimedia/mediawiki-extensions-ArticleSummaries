	"summary": "Scurvy is a disease caused by not getting enough vitamin C. It can make you feel weak, tired, and cause pain in your arms and legs. If left untreated, it can lead to serious problems like gum disease, bleeding skin, and even death.\n\nPeople with mental health issues, strange eating habits, or alcoholism are more likely to get scurvy. It's also rare, but can be found in places with poor nutrition. Eating citrus fruits and certain vegetables gives you vitamin C, and helps prevent scurvy.\n\nIn history, scurvy was a big problem for sailors on long trips, but a doctor named James Lind found that citrus fruits could treat it.",
