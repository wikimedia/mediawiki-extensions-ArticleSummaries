	"summary": "Marsupials are a special group of mammals found mostly in Australia, New Guinea, and the Americas. They have a unique way of reproducing: their babies are born early and grow in their mother's pouch. Well-known marsupials include kangaroos, koalas, and opossums.\n\nThere are over 300 marsupial species, with most living in Australia. They vary in size, from tiny planigales to the giant, extinct Diprotodon. The word 'marsupial' comes from the Latin and Greek words for 'pouch', referring to their distinctive abdominal pouch.",
