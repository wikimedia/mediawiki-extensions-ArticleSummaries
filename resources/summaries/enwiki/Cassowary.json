	"summary": "Cassowaries are large, flightless birds found in tropical forests of New Guinea, the Moluccas, and Australia. There are three living species: southern, northern, and dwarf cassowaries. They are mainly fruit-eaters but also consume plants, fungi, insects, and small animals. Cassowaries are cautious around humans but can be aggressive if threatened. With powerful legs and sharp claws, they can cause severe injuries. Despite their reputation as \"the world's most dangerous bird,\" they are less harmful than ostriches.",
