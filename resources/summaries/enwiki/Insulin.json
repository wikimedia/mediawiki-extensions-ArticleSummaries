	"summary": "Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas that helps your body use sugar (glucose) from food for energy. It works like a key that unlocks doors on cells, allowing sugar to enter and be used for fuel. When you have diabetes, your body doesn't make enough insulin or doesn't use it well, causing too much sugar to stay in your blood. There are two main types of diabetes: Type 1, where the body doesn't make insulin, and Type 2, where the body doesn't use insulin well. Insulin was first discovered in 1921 and has been used to treat diabetes since then.",
