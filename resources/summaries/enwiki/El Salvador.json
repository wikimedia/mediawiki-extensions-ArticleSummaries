Historically, it was ruled by Mesoamerican civilizations like the Mayans and Cuzcatlecs. The Spanish conquered it in the 16th century, and it gained independence in 1821. El Salvador experienced political turmoil and a civil war (1979-1992) due to inequality. After the war, many Salvadorans moved to the U.S. The economy, once reliant on agriculture, has diversified, and the country now uses the U.S. dollar.",
