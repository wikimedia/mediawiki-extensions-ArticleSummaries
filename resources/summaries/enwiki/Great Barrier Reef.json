	"summary": "The Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest coral reef system, stretching over 1,400 miles off the coast of Australia. It's made up of tiny living organisms called coral polyps and is home to many different animals. You can even see it from space! It's a popular tourist spot and helps the local economy. But it's in danger from pollution, climate change, and other threats. Parts of the reef have died, and it's losing its coral cover. Scientists are working to protect it, and a 2022 report showed some recovery.",
