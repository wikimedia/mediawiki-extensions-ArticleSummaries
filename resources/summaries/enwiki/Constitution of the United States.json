	"summary": "## Summary\n\nThe U.S. Constitution, written in 1787, is our country's most important law. It replaced the Articles of Confederation and created a federal government with three branches: legislative (Congress), executive (President), and judicial (Supreme Court).\n\nThe Constitution was drafted in Philadelphia by delegates from 12 states. They debated many issues, including representation and slavery. They reached compromises, like counting three-fifths of slaves for representation and giving each state two senators.\n\nThe Constitution has been amended 27 times, with the first ten amendments, the Bill of Rights, protecting individual freedoms. It's the oldest written constitution still in use today and has inspired other countries.",
