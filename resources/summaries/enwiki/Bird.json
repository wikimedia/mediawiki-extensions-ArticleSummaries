	"summary": "Birds are a diverse group of warm-blooded animals found worldwide. They have feathers, beaks, and lay eggs. Birds can range from tiny hummingbirds to large ostriches. There are over 11,000 species, many of which can fly, though some cannot, like penguins. Birds are related to dinosaurs and have unique adaptations for flight. They are social and communicate through calls and songs. Most are monogamous and care for their young. Birds are important for food, materials, and as pets. Human activities have caused some bird extinctions, but efforts are made to protect them.",
