	"summary": "In 536 AD, a massive volcanic eruption caused a \"volcanic winter,\" the worst climate cooling in the Northern Hemisphere in 2,000 years. This eruption, whose exact location is uncertain, darkened skies and lowered temperatures, especially in Europe. Summer temperatures dropped by around 2.5Â°C. The effects lasted for years, with further eruptions in 539-540 and 547, leading to crop failures, famine, and the Plague of Justinian, which killed millions. This period, known as the Late Antique Little Ice Age, lasted from 536 to 560.",
