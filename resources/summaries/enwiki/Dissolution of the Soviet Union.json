	"summary": "The Soviet Union, a group of 15 republics, ended on December 26, 1991. This was due to political crises and republics wanting independence. Estonia was the first to claim sovereignty in 1988, and Lithuania was the first to fully break away in 1990. After a failed coup in August 1991, more republics left. On December 8, leaders of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus signed the Belovezha Accords, creating the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). By December 25, Mikhail Gorbachev resigned, and the next day, the Soviet Union was officially dissolved. This marked the end of the Cold War and the birth of independent states.",
