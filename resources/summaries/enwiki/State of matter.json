	"summary": "Matter, the stuff around us, can exist in different forms called states. The most common are solids, liquids, gases, and plasma. Solids have a fixed shape and volume, with particles packed close together. Liquids have a fixed volume but take the shape of their container, allowing particles to move. Gases can fill any space, changing volume and shape. Plasma, like gas, is shapeless, but contains charged particles.\n\nThere are also unique states found in extreme conditions, like super-cold condensates and high-energy quarkâ€“gluon plasma. These states show how matter's behavior can be diverse and fascinating!",
