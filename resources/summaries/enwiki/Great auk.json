	"summary": "The great auk, also called the penguin or garefowl, was a large, flightless bird that lived in the North Atlantic. It had black back, white belly, and a big, hooked beak. Great auks were powerful swimmers and ate fish and crustaceans. They bred in small, crowded colonies on remote islands and were known to mate for life.\n\nUnfortunately, humans hunted great auks for food, bait, and their soft feathers. This led to their extinction in the mid-19th century. The last known pair was killed in 1844 off the coast of Iceland.",
