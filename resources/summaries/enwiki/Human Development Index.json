	"summary": "The HDI is a way to measure how well a country's people live. It looks at three main things: how long people live, their education level, and how much money they make. Countries are ranked in four groups based on these factors. A higher HDI score means better living conditions.\n\nThe index was created by economist Mahbub ul-Haq and is used by the United Nations. It helps us understand if people can have a good life, like having enough food, education, and freedom to make choices. However, it doesn't consider everything, like wealth or the quality of goods, which might affect some rich countries' rankings.",
