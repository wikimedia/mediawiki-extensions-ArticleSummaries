	"summary": "Scarlet fever is a sickness caused by strep bacteria, usually affecting kids aged 5 to 15. It gives symptoms like a sore throat, fever, and a rash that feels like sandpaper. The rash is red and can be hard to see on darker skin. It spreads through coughing, sneezing, or touching things with bacteria and then your face.\n\nDoctors can test for it by swabbing your throat. There's no vaccine, but you can prevent it by washing hands and not sharing stuff. Antibiotics can treat it and stop complications like kidney disease. Scarlet fever is less common and milder now than in the past, but there have been recent outbreaks.",
