	"summary": "Endometriosis is a health issue where tissue similar to the uterus lining grows outside the uterus. It can cause pain and fertility problems in women and some mammals. Common symptoms include pelvic pain, heavy periods, and pain during sex. Some people might not show any symptoms.\n\nDiagnosis is made through medical tests and a procedure called laparoscopy. It's often misdiagnosed, leading to a long delay in treatment. The exact cause is unknown, but estrogen (a female hormone) plays a role. Treatment includes painkillers, hormone therapy, and surgery to improve symptoms and fertility.",
