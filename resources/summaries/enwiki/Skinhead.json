	"summary": "Skinheads, or \"skins,\" are young people who started a subculture in London in the 1960s. They have short or shaved hair and wear working-class clothes like boots and button-down shirts. Skinheads were working-class kids who didn't like the rich hippie movement. They loved Jamaican music and fashion. In the 1980s, skinheads mixed with punk culture, creating new music and styles. Some skinheads got into politics, with far-right groups getting attention. But many skinheads stay away from politics, keeping it about their working-class pride.",
