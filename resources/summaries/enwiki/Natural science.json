	"summary": "Natural science is split into two main parts: life science (biology) and physical science (physics, chemistry, earth science, and astronomy). These can be broken down into more specific areas. Natural science uses math and logic to measure and explain nature's laws. Modern natural science developed from older ways of studying nature, with scientists like Galileo and Newton pushing for more mathematical and experimental methods. Even now, natural science still uses some philosophical ideas. Before, natural history involved describing and classifying plants and animals; now, it often refers to observations shared with the public.",
