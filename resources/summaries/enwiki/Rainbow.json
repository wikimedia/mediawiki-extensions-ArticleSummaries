	"summary": "A rainbow is a cool optical trick that happens when sunlight passes through water droplets in the air, like after rain. It looks like a colorful arc in the sky opposite the sun. The primary rainbow has red on the outside and violet on the inside. A double rainbow has a second arc outside the first one, with colors in reverse. This happens because the light bounces around inside the water droplets twice. Rainbows can even form full circles, but we usually only see the top part from the ground.",
