	"summary": "Linguistics is the cool science that explores language. It's like a detective finding clues in how we communicate. Before, it was more about literature, but now it's all about studying language scientifically. Researchers look at how we think, interact, and use words. They examine sentence rules, word structures, sounds, and even how language evolved.\n\nThis field has different branches, like theoretical linguistics, which is all about understanding the big ideas behind language, and applied linguistics, which uses this knowledge to help with teaching and learning. It's a broad subject, covering everything from how babies learn words to how languages change over time.",
