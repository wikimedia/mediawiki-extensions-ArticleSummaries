	"summary": "Alpacas are South American mammals related to llamas. They're often farmed for their soft, valuable wool, which comes in two types: straight \"locks\" (Suri) and wavy \"crimped\" (Huacaya). Alpacas are smaller than llamas and communicate through body language, sometimes spitting to show dominance. They were domesticated from wild vicu√±as and guanacos thousands of years ago. Today, they're found worldwide, with popular breeds in North America, Europe, and Australia.",
