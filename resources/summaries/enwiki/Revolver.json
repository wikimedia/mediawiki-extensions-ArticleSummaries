	"summary": "A revolver is a type of handgun that can fire multiple shots before needing to be reloaded. It has a rotating cylinder with several chambers for bullets. When you pull the trigger, the hammer spins the cylinder, aligning a chamber with the barrel, and the bullet fires. This process repeats for each shot until the cylinder is empty. Revolvers are also known as \"six-shooters\" because many hold six bullets. Famous models include the Colt Single Action Army and Smith & Wesson's. Though semi-automatic pistols are more popular, revolvers are still used by police and for self-defense, hunting, and sports.",
