The explosion was huge, heard thousands of miles away, and caused tsunamis that killed over 36,000 people.  The eruption was so powerful that it sent pressure waves around the Earth multiple times. After the main eruption, there were smaller aftershocks until early 1884. It's considered one of history's worst volcanic disasters.",
