This generation experienced significant historical events like the Great Depression and World War II, which impacted their upbringing. They are known for their traditional values and conformity but also played a role in the civil rights movement and 1960s counterculture. In the UK and other countries, similar generations emerged with comparable characteristics, influenced by the challenges of the mid-20th century.",
