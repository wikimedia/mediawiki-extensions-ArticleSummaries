	"summary": "The lymphatic system is like your body's drainage network, working alongside the circulatory system. It's made up of lymph vessels, nodes, and organs. Its main jobs are to:\n\n- Return fluid (lymph) back to the heart.\n- Fight infections as part of the immune system.\n\nLymph is a clear fluid that collects waste, bacteria, and cells from tissues. Lymph nodes act as filters, trapping unwanted stuff. The system starts with small capillaries that collect fluid, which then travels through larger vessels to lymph nodes, and finally, back into the bloodstream through large ducts.",
