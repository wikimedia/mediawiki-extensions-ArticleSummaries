	"summary": "Pearls are shiny, hard objects made by mollusks like oysters. They're composed of calcium carbonate, just like their shells. Ideal pearls are round and smooth, but unique shapes exist. Natural pearls are rare and valuable, often used in jewelry. Most pearls sold today are farmed.\n\nPearls come in various qualities; the best have a shiny, iridescent look. Lower-quality ones, though still pearls, are less valuable. These gems have been admired and used for centuries, symbolizing rarity and beauty.",
