	"summary": "Hestia is an ancient Greek goddess, the eldest child of Cronus and Rhea. She is the goddess of the home and hearth, symbolizing the fireplace or fireside. As a powerful Olympian, she was respected for her role in sacrificial rituals, receiving the first offering at every domestic sacrifice. Despite her importance, Hestia chose to remain a virgin, focusing on her duties. When new colonies were founded, a flame from her hearth would be carried to bless the new settlement. Her Roman equivalent is Vesta.",
