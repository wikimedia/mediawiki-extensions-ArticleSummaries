During this time, the empire grew very powerful and controlled much of West Asia and North Africa.\n\nAbu Bakr, the first caliph, started conquering the Arabian Peninsula. Umar, the second caliph, expanded the empire quickly, taking over parts of the Byzantine and Sasanian Empires. Uthman and Ali, the next caliphs, faced rebellions and were assassinated. This led to a civil war and the end of the Rashidun Caliphate.\n\nThe empire was known for its strong military, with over 100,000 soldiers at its peak.
