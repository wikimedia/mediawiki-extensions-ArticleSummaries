People usually fill it with meats and vegetables like Vietnamese sausage, cucumber, and pickled carrots. It can also have French-inspired condiments like pâté and mayonnaise.\n\nThe French introduced baguettes to Vietnam in the 1800s, and over time, Vietnamese people created their own sandwich. It became popular street food in Saigon. After the Vietnam War, Vietnamese people living in other countries, like the United States and Canada, made bánh mì popular there too.",
