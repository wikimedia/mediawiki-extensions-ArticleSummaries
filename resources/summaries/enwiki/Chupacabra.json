	"summary": "The chupacabra is a mythical creature in American folklore, known for attacking and drinking the blood of livestock, especially goats. It is described in different ways: in Puerto Rico and Hispanic America, it resembles a large, reptilian creature with spines, while in the U.S. Southwest, it looks more like a dog.\n\nThe first sightings were reported in Puerto Rico in 1995, and since then, similar creatures have been seen in many places worldwide. However, these reports are not considered reliable, and some sightings in Mexico and the U.S. were later identified as mangy canids.",
