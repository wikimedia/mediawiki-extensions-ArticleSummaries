	"summary": "Polygamy means having more than one spouse at the same time. It can be split into two types: polygyny, where a man has multiple wives, and polyandry, where a woman has multiple husbands. Most societies that accept polygamy only allow polygyny.\n\nIn contrast, monogamy is when two people are married. Many countries only recognize monogamous marriages, but some people still practice de facto polygamy, which means they live with multiple partners without official recognition.\n\nPolygamy is more common in certain parts of West and Central Africa, with countries like Burkina Faso and Mali having high rates of polygyny.",
