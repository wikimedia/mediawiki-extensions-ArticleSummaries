	"summary": "Tachycardia is when your heart beats too fast, more than 100 times per minute while resting. It's different from a fast heart rate due to exercise or excitement. This condition can happen due to various reasons, like after a workout, or it might be a sign of a problem within the heart's electrical system. It's important to see a doctor if you often feel your heart racing, as they can help find the cause and suggest the right treatment.",
