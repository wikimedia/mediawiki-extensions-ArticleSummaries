	"summary": "In Spain, an autonomous community is like a state within a country, created to give certain regions more control over their own affairs. There are 17 of these communities and two special cities (Ceuta and Melilla) that can also become autonomous. Each community has its own powers, decided by the Spanish government, to manage things like education and healthcare. These powers vary based on the region's unique needs and history. All communities have a government with a legislature, but no judicial branch.",
