	"summary": "\"The Decameron\" is a book of 100 short stories written by Giovanni Boccaccio in the 14th century. It's like a big collection of tales told by ten young people who are hiding from the Black Death in a villa near Florence. The stories are about love, some funny, some sad, and some that teach a lesson. Boccaccio wrote it in the language people spoke every day, making it a very important piece of Italian literature. It gives us a glimpse of what life was like back then and influenced many other writers, like Chaucer.",
