	"summary": "Ireland is an island nation in Europe, separated from Great Britain by the Irish Sea. It's the 20th largest island globally and is divided into two parts: the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The island has a mild climate and was once mostly woodland.\n\nHistorically, Ireland was divided into many small kingdoms until the Anglo-Norman invasion in the 12th century. Viking settlements and battles also shaped its history. The island later became part of the United Kingdom but split after a war of independence. Today, the Republic of Ireland is a separate country, while Northern Ireland remains part of the UK.",
