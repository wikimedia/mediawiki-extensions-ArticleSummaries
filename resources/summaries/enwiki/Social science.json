	"summary": "Social science is a branch of science that studies societies and relationships between people. It used to mean sociology, but now includes many fields like anthropology, economics, psychology, and political science. Some social scientists use methods like those in natural sciences to understand society, while others use criticism or interpretation. Today, researchers often mix different methods to study social issues. The term \"social research\" is also used when people from different fields work together with similar goals and methods.",
