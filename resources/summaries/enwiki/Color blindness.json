	"summary": "Color blindness, or CVD, makes it hard to see colors or tell them apart. It's often inherited, affecting cone cells in the retina. The most common type is red-green color blindness, affecting up to 1 in 12 males and 1 in 200 females. It's more common in males due to the X chromosome. Other rare types include blue-yellow and complete color blindness (achromatopsia).\n\nCauses can be genetic, or from eye/brain damage. It's usually diagnosed with tests like the Ishihara test. There's no cure, but gene therapy is being studied. People with mild CVD adapt well, but severe cases might need help. Special glasses and apps can assist. Some jobs might be off-limits, but many famous artists are believed to have been color blind.",
