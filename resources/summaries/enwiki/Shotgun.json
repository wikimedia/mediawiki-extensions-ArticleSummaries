Shotguns are known for their spread of pellets, which makes them good for hunting birds and close-range defense. They are also used by the military and police for breaking down doors and controlling crowds.\n\nThe first shotguns were used by cavalry and coachmen. Modern shotguns can fire multiple shots quickly, making them versatile for various tasks. They are popular for sports like skeet shooting, where people aim at moving targets.",
