	"summary": "The Confederate States of America was a group of 11 southern U.S. states that broke away from the United States in 1861. They wanted to protect their economy, which relied on slavery. The Confederacy fought against the U.S. in the Civil War. The war started when the Confederacy attacked Fort Sumter. More states joined, but after four years, they lost. The Confederacy ended in 1865 when its leader, Robert E. Lee, surrendered. These states were later welcomed back into the U.S. during the Reconstruction era. Some people still support the Confederacy today, but many see it as a symbol of slavery and racism.",
