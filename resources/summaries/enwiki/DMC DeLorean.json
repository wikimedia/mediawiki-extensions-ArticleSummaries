	"summary": "The DeLorean DMC-12 is a unique sports car made by the DeLorean Motor Company. It was produced from 1981 to 1983 and is known for its cool gull-wing doors and shiny stainless-steel body. The car was designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro but had some performance issues. It gained fame from the \"Back to the Future\" movies, even though its production was short. About 8,500 to 9,600 were made before the company went bankrupt. Despite mixed reviews, many people still love DeLoreans, and around 6,500 were still driven on roads in 2015.",
