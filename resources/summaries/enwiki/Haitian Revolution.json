	"summary": "The Haitian Revolution (1791â€“1804) was a slave rebellion in the French colony of Saint-Domingue. Led by former slaves like Toussaint Louverture, they fought for freedom and independence. This revolution was unique because it resulted in a free, independent nation led by people of color.\n\nThe revolt challenged the idea of black inferiority and inspired other enslaved people across the Americas. Despite its significance, the Haitian Revolution is often overshadowed by other Atlantic revolutions in historical discussions.",
