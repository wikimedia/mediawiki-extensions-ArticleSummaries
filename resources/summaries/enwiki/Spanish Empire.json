	"summary": "The Spanish Empire was one of the largest and most powerful empires in history, lasting from 1492 to 1976. It explored and colonized much of the world, including large areas of the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Oceania. At its peak, it covered over 13 million square kilometers. Spain's influence can still be seen today in Latin America, where Spanish is the main language and Catholicism is widespread. The empire faced challenges from other European powers and lost many of its colonies in the 19th century.",
