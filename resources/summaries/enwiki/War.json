	"summary": "War is a serious fight between countries or groups with powerful weapons. It involves a lot of violence, destruction, and sadly, many deaths. These conflicts can be between armies or smaller groups with strong leaders. Some people think war is part of human nature, while others believe it's caused by specific problems like social issues, money, or resources.\n\nWarfare is the term for all the actions and events that happen during wars. Total war is the most severe kind, where not only soldiers but also innocent people are hurt.",
