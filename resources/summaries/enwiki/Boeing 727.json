	"summary": "The Boeing 727 is an American passenger airplane. It was made to fly shorter distances than the 707, which was too heavy for some airports. The 727 first flew in 1963 and was used by many airlines. It has three engines and can carry around 100 to 150 passengers, depending on the model. The 727-200, a longer version, could fly a bit further. It was last used for commercial flights in 2019. Over time, it was replaced by newer planes like the 757.",
