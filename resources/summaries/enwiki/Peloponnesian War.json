	"summary": "The Peloponnesian War (431â€“404 BC) was a big fight between Athens and Sparta, two powerful Greek city-states, and their allies. It had three main parts. First, Sparta tried to invade Athens but couldn't get past Athens' strong walls. Then, there was a shaky peace. Finally, Sparta, with help from Persia, built a strong navy and defeated Athens at sea. This ended Athens' power and made Sparta the top city in Greece. The war changed Greece a lot, making it poorer and more violent.",
