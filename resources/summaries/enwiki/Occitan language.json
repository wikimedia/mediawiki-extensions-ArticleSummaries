	"summary": "Occitan, also called *lenga d'òc*, is a language spoken in parts of France, Italy, Spain, and Monaco. It has many dialects, and people in different regions might call it different names, like Provençal or Gascon. Occitan is related to Catalan, which is spoken in Spain.\n\nThis language isn't officially recognized in France, and it's in danger of disappearing. UNESCO says many of its dialects are severely endangered. There are efforts to create a standard written form, but it's hard because the dialects are quite different.",
