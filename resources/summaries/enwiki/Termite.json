	"summary": "Termites are social insects that eat dead plant material, especially wood. They look like \"white ants\" but are not related to ants. There are nearly 3,000 known species worldwide, with the most variety in the tropics.\n\nThese insects live in large colonies, like superorganisms, with different roles for each member. They go through incomplete metamorphosis. Termites are important for breaking down dead plants in nature. Some people even eat them or use them in medicine! But a few species are harmful to buildings. Climate change might cause these destructive termites to spread.",
