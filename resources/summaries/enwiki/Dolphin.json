	"summary": "Dolphins are ocean-dwelling mammals related to whales. There are 40 different dolphin species, varying in size from the small Maui's dolphin to the massive orca. They have streamlined bodies, flippers, and sharp teeth for catching fish and squid. Dolphins are known for their intelligence, speed, and excellent hearing. Some can dive deeply and communicate using clicks and whistles.\n\nThese mammals live in various climates, from tropical to cold waters. They often mate with multiple partners, and females raise their young alone. Unfortunately, dolphins face threats like hunting, pollution, and habitat loss.",
