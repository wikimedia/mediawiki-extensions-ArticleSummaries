	"summary": "The Franks were a powerful group of people who lived in Europe during ancient times. They started as Germanic tribes near the Rhine River and later became a major force in the Roman Empire and the Middle Ages. The Merovingian dynasty, led by kings Childeric I and Clovis I, unified parts of modern-day France and Germany. This dynasty's success led to the rise of the Carolingians, who became emperors of Western Europe. Over time, the Frankish realm split into two kingdoms, one of which became the Kingdom of France. The name \"Franks\" was used to describe Western Europeans, especially during the Crusades.",
