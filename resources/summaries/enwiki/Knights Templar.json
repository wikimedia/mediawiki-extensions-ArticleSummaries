	"summary": "The Knights Templar was a powerful Catholic military order founded around 1119 to protect pilgrims in Jerusalem. They were known for their white mantles with a red cross. The Templars were skilled warriors and had a huge economic impact, developing early banking techniques. They became very influential but faced decline as the Crusades ended. In 1307, King Philip IV of France had many Templars arrested and executed, leading to the order's disbandment in 1312. Their sudden disappearance sparked legends and mysteries that still fascinate people today.",
