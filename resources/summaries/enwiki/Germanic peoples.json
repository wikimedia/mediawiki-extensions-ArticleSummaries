	"summary": "The Germanic peoples were ancient tribes who lived in Northern Europe. They included groups like the Goths and Germani, who spoke Germanic languages. These peoples lived in areas from present-day Germany to Scandinavia and Eastern Europe.\n\nRoman writers first mentioned them around 100 BCE. The Romans tried to conquer the Germanic lands but were often defeated. Over time, Germanic tribes moved into the Roman Empire, eventually forming their own kingdoms.\n\nGermanic culture was complex, with its own religion, runic writing, and laws. Many Germanic peoples later converted to Christianity. The study of the Germanic past has been influenced by nationalism and racism, but modern scholars aim to present a more accurate picture.",
