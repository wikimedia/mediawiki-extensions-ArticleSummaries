	"summary": "The Bible is a collection of sacred stories and writings for many religions, including Christianity and Judaism. It's like a giant book of ancient instructions, poems, and prophecies, originally written in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. The first part, the Old Testament, was put together by Jewish communities. Christians added the New Testament, which includes the life of Jesus and early Christian letters.\n\nThe Gutenberg Bible, made in the 1400s, was the first printed Bible, and it's super important because it helped spread these stories worldwide. Today, the Bible is the best-selling book ever, translated into countless languages.",
