	"summary": "Chiropractic is a type of alternative medicine that focuses on treating muscle and bone problems, especially in the spine. Chiropractors believe that adjusting the spine can improve overall health. They use hands-on techniques and may offer advice on exercise and lifestyle.\n\nWhile some people find it helpful for back pain, scientific studies have not proven that chiropractic adjustments work for other health issues. There are also concerns about safety, as serious side effects are rare but possible. Chiropractic care is popular in some countries and has a long history, but it remains controversial due to its non-scientific roots.",
