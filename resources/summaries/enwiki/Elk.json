	"summary": "Elk, also known as wapiti, are one of the largest deer species, native to North America and Asia. They were once more widespread, including parts of Europe. With their distinctive white rump patch, elk live in forests and eat plants, grasses, and bark. Male elk have impressive antlers that they shed each year. They use unique behaviors like bugling (loud calls) to attract mates and assert dominance.\n\nGenetic studies show that elk are distinct from European red deer. They have been introduced to countries like Argentina and New Zealand, but their adaptability can pose risks to local ecosystems. Elk are important in some cultures for their spiritual value and are also hunted for their meat, which is lean and protein-rich.",
