	"summary": "*Striptease* is a comedy movie about an FBI secretary who becomes a stripper. It stars Demi Moore and was made from a popular book. Moore got paid a lot of money to act in it, but the movie wasn't very good. Critics didn't like it, and it won some \"worst movie\" awards. Even though it made a lot of money, the film's failure made people think less of Moore's acting career.",
