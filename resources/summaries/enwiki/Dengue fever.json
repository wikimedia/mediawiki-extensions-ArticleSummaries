	"summary": "Dengue fever is a disease spread by mosquitoes, mainly in tropical areas. Most people don't show symptoms, but some get high fever, headaches, and a rash. In severe cases, it can cause bleeding and low blood pressure, known as severe dengue. There are four types of the virus, and getting infected with one type doesn't protect you from the others. Treatment includes pain relief and fluids. Two vaccines are available, but they are only recommended for specific groups. Dengue is a growing problem, affecting millions worldwide, and it's getting worse due to climate change.",
