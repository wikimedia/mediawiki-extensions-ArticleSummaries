	"summary": "Narwhals are unique whales found in the Arctic. They are known for their long, spiral tusk, which is actually a tooth! This tusk is used for many things, like fighting and impressing mates. Narwhals live in cold waters and can dive very deep to find food like fish and squid. They travel in small groups and migrate to warmer areas in summer.\n\nThere are around 170,000 narwhals, and they are important to the Inuit people for food and ivory. However, climate change and pollution are threats to their future.",
