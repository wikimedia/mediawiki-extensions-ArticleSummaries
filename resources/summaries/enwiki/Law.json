	"summary": "Law is a set of rules made by governments or society to control behavior. These rules can be created by lawmakers, judges, or even agreed upon by people in contracts. Laws are used to keep order, resolve disputes, and protect people's rights.\n\nThere are different types of law, like public law (dealing with government) and private law (dealing with people's issues). Laws vary from place to place, and some countries use religious laws like Sharia. Studying law helps us understand history, economics, and how to treat each other fairly.",
