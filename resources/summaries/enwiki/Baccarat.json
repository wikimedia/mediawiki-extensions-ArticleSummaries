	"summary": "Baccarat is a popular casino card game where players bet on which hand will win: the \"player\" or the \"banker.\" The game has three types: punto banco, chemin de fer, and banque. In punto banco, players' actions are determined by their cards. The other two variants allow players to make choices. Baccarat has a house edge, meaning the bank has slightly better odds of winning, making it a favorite among high-rollers.",
