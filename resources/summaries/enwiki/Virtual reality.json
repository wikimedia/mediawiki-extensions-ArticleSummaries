	"summary": "Virtual reality (VR) is like stepping into a computer-made world. It uses special headsets or rooms to make you feel like you're inside a game or a place. You can look around, move, and interact with things that aren't real. It's not just for fun; VR helps people learn new skills, like doctors practicing surgery, or soldiers training for battles. It's a cool way to trick your brain into thinking you're somewhere else!",
