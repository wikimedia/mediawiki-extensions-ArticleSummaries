	"summary": "Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is an irregular heartbeat that can be rapid and unpredictable. It happens when the heart's upper chambers (atria) beat chaotically. Some people might not feel anything, but others may experience palpitations, shortness of breath, or chest pain. AFib increases the risk of stroke, heart failure, and dementia.\n\nCommon causes include high blood pressure, heart disease, and lung problems. Lifestyle changes like losing weight and reducing alcohol intake can help. Treatment options are available, such as medications to control heart rate or restore normal rhythm, and procedures like ablation. AFib is a global health issue, affecting millions, and its prevalence increases with age.",
