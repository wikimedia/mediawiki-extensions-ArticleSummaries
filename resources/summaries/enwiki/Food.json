	"summary": "Food is what we eat to stay healthy and energized. It comes from plants, animals, and fungi, providing our bodies with nutrients like carbs, fats, proteins, vitamins, and minerals. Different animals have unique ways of finding food. Humans, being omnivores, can eat many types of food and often cook it before eating.\n\nMost of our food is produced by the industrial food industry, which uses large-scale farming and complex processing. However, this system is harmful to the environment, contributing to climate change due to its reliance on fossil fuels. It also affects other important issues like biodiversity, economics, and food security. Organizations like the FAO and WFP work to ensure food safety and help those in need.",
