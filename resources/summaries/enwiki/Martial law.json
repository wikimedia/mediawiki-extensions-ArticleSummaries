	"summary": "Martial law means the military takes control instead of regular government leaders. This happens during times of crisis like wars, emergencies, or when there's a lot of unrest in a country. When martial law is in place, regular laws might not apply, and the military makes the rules. Civil liberties, like freedom of speech, can be limited during this time. It's usually a temporary measure but can last a long time if needed.",
