There are now 63 national parks across 30 states and two territories, with California having the most. These parks are known for their natural beauty, unique features, and ecosystems. They offer recreational activities and are managed by the National Park Service, which has a mission to preserve these areas for future generations. National parks can be very large, like Wrangellâ€“St. Elias in Alaska, or smaller like Gateway Arch National Park in Missouri. They attract millions of visitors each year, with Great Smoky Mountains being the most-visited park.",
