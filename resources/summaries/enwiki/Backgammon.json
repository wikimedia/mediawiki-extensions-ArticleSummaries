	"summary": "Backgammon is a popular board game played by two people. It has a long history, originating from ancient Mesopotamia and Persia. The game involves moving 15 pieces, called \"men\" or \"checkers,\" around a board with 24 points based on dice rolls. The goal is to be the first to remove all your pieces. It's a mix of strategy and luck, where skilled players can make smart moves and predict their opponent's actions. The game can be more exciting with a \"doubling cube,\" which increases the stakes.",
