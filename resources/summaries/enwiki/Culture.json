	"summary": "Culture is how we live, think, and express ourselves as humans. It includes our beliefs, art, laws, and daily habits, shaping our behavior and identity. Prehistoric humans developed symbolic expression, leading to diverse cultures worldwide.\n\nCulture is learned through enculturation and socialization, making each society unique. Norms guide our actions, like a dress code or expected behavior. Having various cultures is essential, as it allows people to adapt to changes, much like different plant species in an ecosystem. UNESCO works to protect these cultural heritages.",
