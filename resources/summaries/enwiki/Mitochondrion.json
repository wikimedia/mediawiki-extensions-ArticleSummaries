	"summary": "Mitochondria, found in most eukaryotic cells, are like tiny power plants. They make energy for the cell using a process called aerobic respiration. Discovered in 1857, they were named \"mitochondria\" in 1898. Often called the \"powerhouse of the cell,\" they have their own DNA, similar to bacteria. This supports the idea that mitochondria were once free-living creatures that joined with other cells long ago. Some cells, like red blood cells, don't have mitochondria. They come in different sizes and shapes and play roles in cell signaling and growth.",
