The complex was designed by Minoru Yamasaki and cost around $400 million to build. It became a symbol of New York and global trade.\n\nOn September 11, 2001, the WTC was attacked by terrorists, resulting in the collapse of the Twin Towers and nearby buildings. This tragic event led to the loss of 2,606 lives. After the attacks, the site underwent a lengthy cleanup and rebuilding process. Today, a new WTC complex stands there, featuring a memorial, museum, and new skyscrapers, with One World Trade Center as its centerpiece.",
