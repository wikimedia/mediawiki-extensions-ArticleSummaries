	"summary": "Peat is a pile of partly rotten plants found in wet areas like bogs and mires. It's made mostly of sphagnum moss. Peat forms slowly when water stops oxygen from breaking down the plants completely. It can be used in gardens but is being banned in some places. Peat is also a source of fossil fuels like coal. It's an important carbon sink, meaning it stores a lot of carbon dioxide. However, it's not renewable because it takes thousands of years to form and is being used up quickly.",
