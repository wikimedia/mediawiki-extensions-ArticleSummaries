	"summary": "Nitroglycerin is a colorless, oily liquid explosive discovered in 1846. It's made by reacting glycerol with nitric acid. This substance is commonly used in construction and mining as a key ingredient in explosives like dynamite. It's also sensitive to heat and can explode if not handled carefully.\n\nInterestingly, nitroglycerin has a medical use too! It's been used for over 130 years to treat heart problems by widening blood vessels. It works by converting into nitric oxide, which relaxes blood vessels.",
