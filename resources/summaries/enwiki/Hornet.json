	"summary": "Hornets are the biggest social wasps, looking like yellowjackets but with a larger head. There are 22 species worldwide, mostly in Asia, but the European hornet is found in many places. They make paper nests by chewing wood, with one queen and female workers who can't reproduce. Nests are usually in trees, but some are underground. Hornets protect their nests aggressively, and their stings can be more harmful than bees'. Male hornets are calm and can't sting.",
