	"summary": "Homeopathy is a type of alternative medicine that started in the late 1700s. It's based on the idea that a tiny amount of a substance that makes people sick can also cure similar symptoms. Homeopaths make remedies by diluting these substances many times, until there's likely no trace left. They believe this process makes the remedy stronger.\n\nHowever, scientists and doctors disagree. They say there's no proof that homeopathy works, and it's considered quackery. Many countries have stopped funding homeopathy because it's not effective and can be dangerous if it delays proper medical treatment.",
