	"summary": "The spleen is an organ found in most vertebrates, including humans. It acts like a blood filter and is located in the left upper part of your belly. Its main jobs are to get rid of old red blood cells, store extra blood, and help fight infections. It also recycles iron from old blood cells. The spleen is important for your immune system, as it has cells that make antibodies to fight germs. If someone has their spleen removed (a splenectomy), they might be more likely to get certain infections.",
