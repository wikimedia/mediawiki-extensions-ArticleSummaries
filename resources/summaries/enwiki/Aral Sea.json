	"summary": "The Aral Sea, once the world's third-largest lake, shrunk in the 1960s due to Soviet irrigation projects. By the 2010s, it had almost dried up, splitting into four smaller lakes. Located between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, it was an important source of fish and supported a thriving industry. The shrinking sea caused major environmental problems, including pollution and health issues. Efforts to save the North Aral Sea in Kazakhstan have had some success, but the overall situation remains critical.",
