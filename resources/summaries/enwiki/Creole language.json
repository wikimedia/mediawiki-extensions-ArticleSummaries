	"summary": "A creole language is a unique type of language that forms when different languages mix and simplify, often due to people from various backgrounds needing to communicate. This process happens quickly, and the new language becomes the native tongue for many. Creole languages have simple grammar rules, making them easy to learn. They are different from pidgins, which are simpler and not used as native languages. Many creole languages started with European languages like English and French due to historical events like the slave trade. These languages develop their own words and sounds, sometimes changing from their original forms.",
