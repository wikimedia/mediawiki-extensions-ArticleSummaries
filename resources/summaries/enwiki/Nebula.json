	"summary": "A nebula is a huge cloud of gas and dust in space, often where stars are born. They can be hundreds of light-years wide but are mostly empty space. Some, like the Orion Nebula, can be seen with the naked eye from Earth. Nebulae can glow because of nearby hot stars. Originally, the term \"nebula\" was used for any blurry object in space, including galaxies, but now it refers to these star-forming clouds.",
