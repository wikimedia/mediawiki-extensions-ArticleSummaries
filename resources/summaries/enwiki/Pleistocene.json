	"summary": "The Pleistocene, often called the Ice Age, was an epoch from about 2.58 million to 11,700 years ago. It was a time of repeated glaciations, meaning huge ice sheets covered large parts of the Earth. The continents of North and South America connected, affecting climate and animal life.\n\nEarly in the Pleistocene, ancient humans appeared in Africa and spread across Afro-Eurasia. Later, modern humans left Africa, reaching Australia and the Americas. Many large animal species went extinct during this time. The climate was very changeable, with long cold periods and warmer intervals.",
