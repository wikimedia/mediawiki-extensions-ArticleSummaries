	"summary": "The Western Wall, also known as the Wailing Wall, is an ancient wall in Jerusalem with great religious significance for Jews. It is a retaining wall of the Temple Mount, believed to be built by Herod the Great. Jews come here to pray as it is the closest they can get to the Holy of Holies, the holiest site in Judaism.\n\nThe wall has a long history, facing restrictions and violence at times. It was once a place of Jewish mourning during Christian Roman rule. Later, it became a source of tension between Jews and Muslims. After the Six-Day War in 1967, Israel gained control, and the wall became a popular prayer site.",
