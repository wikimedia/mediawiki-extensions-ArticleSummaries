	"summary": "\"Pinkerton\" is the second album by the American rock band Weezer, released in 1996. Most of the songs were written by the band's guitarist, Rivers Cuomo, while he was studying at Harvard. The album has a darker sound than their first one and talks about loneliness and being disappointed with the rock star life. It's named after a character from the opera \"Madama Butterfly\" who is like a touring rock star. Although it didn't sell as well as expected at first, people started to like it more over time, and it even went platinum in the US in 2016. Many emo bands say it influenced them.",
