First mentioned in the Bible, it later became a significant relic in medieval times. Several objects claiming to be the lance or its parts have appeared over the centuries, with four major relics existing today in Rome, Vienna, Vagharshapat, and Antioch. The most famous one is in Vienna, displayed with imperial regalia. These relics have been used in religious ceremonies and were once believed to bring victory in battle.",
