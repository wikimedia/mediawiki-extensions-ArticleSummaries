	"summary": "Xylitol is a type of sugar alcohol used as a food additive and sugar substitute. It has the formula C5H12O5 and appears as a white, soluble crystal. The name comes from the Greek word for wood. Xylitol is often used in gum and other candies as it doesn't cause tooth decay like sugar. While it may promote better dental health, more research is needed to confirm its cavity-preventing effects. In the U.S., xylitol is considered safe for consumption.",
