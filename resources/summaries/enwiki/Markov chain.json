It's named after Andrey Markov, a Russian mathematician.\n\nThese processes can be **discrete** (like steps in time) or **continuous** (like time flowing smoothly). They are used in many fields to model random events, from weather patterns to stock prices. We call things related to these processes **Markovian**.",
