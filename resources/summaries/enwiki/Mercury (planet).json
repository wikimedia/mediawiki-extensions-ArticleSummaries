	"summary": "Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system, located closest to the Sun. Named after the Roman god Mercury, it has a rocky surface covered in craters from many impacts. Its day and year are unique: one day on Mercury is as long as two of its years. This planet experiences extreme temperatures, from very cold nights to extremely hot days. Mercury has no moon and a weak magnetic field. Scientists are still studying its formation, but they believe it's about 4.5 billion years old, with a possible history of magma oceans and core changes.",
