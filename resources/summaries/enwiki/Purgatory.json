	"summary": "Purgatory is a place in some religions where souls go after death to be cleaned before entering heaven. It's like a final test or purification process. In Catholic belief, it's for people who have been forgiven but still need to get rid of any remaining bad habits or attachments to the world. This process can involve a bit of \"punishment,\" often shown as fire in art, but it's not meant to be cruel. Instead, it helps souls become ready for heaven. Many other religions have similar ideas, even if they use different names.",
