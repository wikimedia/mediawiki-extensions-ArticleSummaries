	"summary": "Osteopathy is a type of alternative medicine that focuses on fixing problems in the body by moving and adjusting muscles and bones. It was started by Andrew Taylor Still in the late 1800s. Osteopaths believe that all parts of the body are connected by a layer of tissue. They try to find and fix problems in this tissue, called \"somatic dysfunction,\" to help people feel better. While some osteopaths are medical doctors, many are not. In the U.S., osteopathic medicine has become a recognized medical field, but traditional osteopathy is still practiced outside of medicine.",
