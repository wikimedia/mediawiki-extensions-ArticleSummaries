	"summary": "The Sphere, by artist Fritz Koenig, is a huge bronze sculpture that stood between the World Trade Center's Twin Towers. It survived the September 11 attacks, becoming a memorial. Originally stored after the disaster, it was later placed in Battery Park and then moved to Liberty Park, overlooking the 9/11 Memorial. The sculpture, weighing over 20 tons, remains in the damaged state it was found in, serving as a powerful reminder of the attacks.",
