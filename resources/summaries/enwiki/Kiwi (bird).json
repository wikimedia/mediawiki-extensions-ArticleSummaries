	"summary": "Kiwi are small, flightless birds found only in New Zealand. They are related to extinct elephant birds from Madagascar, not the moa. There are five species, all facing threats like habitat loss and invasive predators. Kiwi have tiny wings hidden under spiky feathers, and they lay huge eggs relative to their size. Their strong legs and keen sense of smell help them find food. Kiwi are famous worldwide and are a symbol of New Zealand and its people, known as Kiwis.",
