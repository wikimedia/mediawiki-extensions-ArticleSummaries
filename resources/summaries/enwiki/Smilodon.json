Smilodon lived in the Americas during the ice ages and went extinct around 10,000 years ago.\n\nIt hunted large animals like bison and camels, using its strong front legs to hold prey still while it bit with its deadly teeth. We don't know for sure if Smilodon lived alone or in groups. Three species existed, with the largest, S. populator, weighing up to 961 pounds!",
