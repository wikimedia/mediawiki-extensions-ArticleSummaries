It began when Charlemagne, a king from France, was crowned Roman Emperor in 800 AD. After a brief pause, the empire was revived in 962 AD and grew in power. At its peak, it covered much of Central and Western Europe. The empire was led by an elected emperor and was known for its complex government and territorial expansion. However, it faced challenges and eventually ended in 1806 due to wars and political changes.",
