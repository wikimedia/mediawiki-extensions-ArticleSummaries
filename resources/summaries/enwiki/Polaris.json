	"summary": "Polaris, also known as the North Star, is a bright star in the constellation Ursa Minor. It's easily seen in the night sky and is special because it stays in almost the same spot, making it useful for finding directions. This is because it's very close to the North Pole of the sky. Polaris is actually a triple star system, made up of two orbiting stars (Polaris Aa and Ab) and a third star (Polaris B) further away. Scientists use Polaris to help measure distances in space.",
