	"summary": "PPP is a way to compare how much money is worth in different countries. It looks at the cost of the same basket of goods in various places. The idea is to see how much \"buying power\" each currency has. This can help us understand the real value of a country's economy, like its GDP, productivity, and people's spending. The PPP calculation includes many everyday items, services, and even construction projects to get a fair comparison. Tariffs and other costs might make the PPP rate different from the usual exchange rate.",
