	"summary": "The Reconquista was a long fight where Christian kingdoms in Europe took back land from Muslim rulers in Spain. It started around 718 AD and ended in 1492 when the last Muslim kingdom, Granada, was defeated.\n\nFor a long time, Christian armies fought against the Muslim Umayyad Caliphate. After the Muslim power weakened, Christian kings like those in Portugal, Le√≥n-Castile, and Aragon got stronger. They took over most of Spain, forcing Muslims and Jews to leave or convert to Christianity.\n\nThis time in history is important for Spain's identity and is still remembered in festivals and by some political groups today.",
