	"summary": "Mammals are a group of vertebrate animals with some unique features. They have mammary glands to feed their young with milk, a special brain region called the neocortex, fur, and three small bones in their ears. These traits set them apart from reptiles and birds. There are over 6,400 different mammal species, like rodents, bats, primates (including humans), and whales.\n\nMammals have a long history, evolving from ancient synapsids. They became diverse after dinosaurs went extinct and have been the main land animals for millions of years. They can live in various places, from oceans to trees, and range in size from tiny bats to massive blue whales. Most give birth to live young, but some, like the platypus, lay eggs.",
