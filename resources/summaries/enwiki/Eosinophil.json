These cells have a unique appearance, with large granules that make them look red when stained. They are found in certain parts of our body, like the thymus, gastrointestinal tract, and lymph nodes. In healthy people, they make up a small percentage of white blood cells. However, their presence in other organs can indicate a disease, such as eosinophilic asthma, where they cause inflammation.",
