	"summary": "Hebrew is an ancient Semitic language that was spoken by the Israelites. It has a long history, dating back to the 10th century BCE. Originally used as a daily language, it became the sacred tongue of Judaism. After a period of decline, Hebrew was revived in the 19th century and is now the official language of Israel, known as Modern Hebrew. It's also used in religious settings by Jewish and Samaritan communities worldwide. The language's unique alphabet and rich history make it an important part of cultural and religious identity.",
