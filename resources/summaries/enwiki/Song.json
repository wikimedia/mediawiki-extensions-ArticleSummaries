Songs can be a cappella (without instruments) or accompanied. Lyrics are the written words of a song. There are different types of songs, such as popular songs, art songs, and folk songs, each with their own style and performance settings. In jazz and classical music, singers may improvise or follow sheet music, respectively. Songs can be performed solo, with a backing band, or with various instruments.",
