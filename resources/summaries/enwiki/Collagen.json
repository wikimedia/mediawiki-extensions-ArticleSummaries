	"summary": "Collagen is the most common protein in mammals, making up 25% to 35% of our body's protein. It forms strong, flexible tissues like cartilage, bones, tendons, and skin. Three long molecules twist together to make a collagen fiber, called a triple helix. Vitamin C helps make collagen, and vitamin E boosts its production. Collagen is also found in eyes, blood vessels, guts, and teeth. Gelatin, used in food, is made from collagen broken down by heat or chemicals. Fibroblast cells are the main collagen makers in our bodies.",
