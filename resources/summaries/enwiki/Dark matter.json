	"summary": "Dark matter is like an invisible force in space. Scientists think it exists because they can see its effect on things like galaxies and the universe's structure. It doesn't interact with light, so we can't see it. Most scientists believe it's made of tiny particles we haven't discovered yet.\n\nDark matter makes up about 85% of the universe's mass, while something called dark energy makes up even more. Scientists are still trying to understand what dark matter is and how it works. Some think it might be related to gravity.",
