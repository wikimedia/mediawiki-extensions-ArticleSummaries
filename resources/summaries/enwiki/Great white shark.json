	"summary": "The great white shark, also called the white shark or great white, is a large shark found in oceans worldwide. It's the biggest known predator fish, growing up to 19 feet long and weighing over 4,000 pounds. These sharks live for about 70 years and can swim very fast and dive very deep. They eat marine mammals, fish, and other sharks. Orcas are their only known predator. Great white sharks are protected because their numbers are low, and they can't be kept in aquariums easily. Despite their fearsome reputation, attacks on humans are rare.",
