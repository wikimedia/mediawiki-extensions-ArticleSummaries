He gathered unhappy people, including wealthy elites and poor farmers, to seize power from the consuls, Cicero and Gaius Antonius Hybrida. Cicero exposed the plan, sending Catiline fleeing.  More conspirators were later executed, and Catiline was finally defeated in battle. Historians debate how big a threat the conspiracy really was, believing Cicero might have exaggerated its danger for political gain.",
