	"summary": "Chameleons are a unique group of lizards with over 200 species. They are famous for changing colors, from simple shade shifts to vibrant hues like red, yellow, and blue. These lizards have special features like zygodactylous feet, prehensile tails, and horn-like structures. Their eyes move independently, giving them a 3D view of their surroundings when needed. Chameleons hunt insects and small animals during the day and can live in trees or on the ground. Most are found in Africa, with some in Europe, Asia, and even Hawaii and Florida.",
