	"summary": "Commedia dell'arte was a popular theater style from Italy between the 16th and 18th centuries. It featured masked characters, like the clever Harlequin and the greedy old man Pantalone. Performances were often improvised, with actors following a basic script and adding their own jokes and movements. These plays were usually performed outside in town squares. The tradition started in Italy but spread across Europe, even reaching Moscow. Commedia dell'arte is believed to have begun during the Venice Carnival, where characters like Pantalone originated.",
