	"summary": "Leptospirosis is a serious disease caused by bacteria called Leptospira. It affects many animals, including humans, dogs, and rodents. Symptoms can be mild, like headaches and fever, or severe, leading to bleeding in the lungs or meningitis. In the worst cases, called Weil's disease, people can turn yellow (jaundice), have kidney failure, and bleed.\n\nThe bacteria spread through animal urine and feces, entering the body through the eyes, mouth, or skin cuts. It's common in tropical areas and after heavy rain. Protecting yourself with gear and washing after contact with animals can help prevent it. Antibiotics like doxycycline can treat and prevent the disease.",
