According to the Bible, God asked Abraham to move to Canaan, promising him land and many descendants. Abraham is said to have bought a tomb there, claiming the land for his family. His story is about trusting God's promises and is used to connect believers to their faith and history. However, archaeologists haven't found proof that Abraham existed.",
