	"summary": "The French flag, called the Tricolour, has three vertical stripes: blue, white, and red. It was inspired by the Dutch flag and adopted after the French Revolution. The colors were chosen from the Paris militia's cockade (blue and red) and added white, a traditional French color. The Tricolour became a symbol of opposition to the old royal flags. It has been used since 1790, with a brief interruption, and was brought back after the July Revolution. France officially uses the older version of the flag with navy blue.",
