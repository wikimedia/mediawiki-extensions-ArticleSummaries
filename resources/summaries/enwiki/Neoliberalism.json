	"summary": "Neoliberalism is an economic and political idea that became popular in the late 20th century. It brings back old concepts of free-market capitalism. This philosophy started in Europe in the 1930s as a reaction to the problems with classical liberalism. The goal was to make markets more stable after the Great Depression. Neoliberal policies gained attention in the 1970s to fight economic issues like stagflation. It's linked to right-wing groups and leaders like Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. Neoliberalism pushes for less government control, more private business, and global trade.",
