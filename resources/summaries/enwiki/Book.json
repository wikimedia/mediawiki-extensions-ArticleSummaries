	"summary": "A book is like a magical container for stories and information. It's usually made of many pages bound together, with a cover to protect it. Before the printing press, people used scrolls and tablets. Books can be fiction (made-up stories) or non-fiction (real facts). They can also be just pictures, puzzles, or even blank pages for your own use.\n\nYou can buy books in stores or online, borrow them from libraries, or enjoy them as ebooks or audiobooks. With new technology, the book world keeps changing, even helping people with special needs by offering formats like braille. There are millions of books out there, each telling a unique tale!",
