	"summary": "The 2024 Sri Lankan presidential election was held on September 21, 2024, with incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe seeking re-election. Other candidates included Sajith Premadasa, Anura Kumara Dissanayake, and Namal Rajapaksa. No candidate won a majority in the first round, so a second round of voting was held for the first time in the country's history. Dissanayake ultimately won with 55.89% of the vote in the second round, becoming the first third-party candidate to be elected president in Sri Lanka. This election also marked a political realignment, as neither of the top two candidates were endorsed by the traditional ruling parties. Dissanayake was inaugurated on September 23.",
