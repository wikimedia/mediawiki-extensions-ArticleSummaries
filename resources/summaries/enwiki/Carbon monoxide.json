	"summary": "Carbon monoxide (CO) is a dangerous gas that you can't see, smell, or taste. It's made of one carbon and one oxygen atom. This gas is produced when things like wood or gas don't burn completely. It's used in making medicines and fuels, but it's also a big problem in the air we breathe. Indoor sources, like stoves or heaters, can release CO and cause poisoning. Even our bodies make small amounts of it, which is normal, but too much is very harmful.",
