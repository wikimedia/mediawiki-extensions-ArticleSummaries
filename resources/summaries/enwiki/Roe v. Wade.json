	"summary": "In 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution protects a woman's right to have an abortion. This decision, known as *Roe v. Wade*, made abortion legal across the country. The case was about a woman named Norma McCorvey, who wanted an abortion but lived in a state where it was illegal. The Court said that the right to privacy includes the right to choose whether to have a baby.\n\nHowever, in 2022, the Supreme Court changed its mind and said that the Constitution does not protect the right to abortion. This means that now, individual states can decide whether abortion is legal or not.",
