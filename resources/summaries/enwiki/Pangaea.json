	"summary": "Pangaea was a giant landmass that existed long ago, around 335 million years ago. It was formed when smaller continents joined together, creating a huge C-shaped supercontinent. This supercontinent included what we now know as Africa, South America, and parts of Europe and Asia. Over time, around 200 million years ago, Pangaea started to split apart, forming the continents we recognize today. It was surrounded by vast oceans, and its existence was first discovered by geologists studying Earth's history.",
