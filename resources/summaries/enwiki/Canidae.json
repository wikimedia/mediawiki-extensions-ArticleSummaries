	"summary": "Canidae is a family of dog-like meat-eating animals, including dogs, wolves, and foxes. The name comes from the Latin word for \"dog.\" There are three groups: Caninae (canines), Borophaginae (extinct), and Hesperocyoninae (extinct). Canines live on every continent except Antarctica. They range in size from the large gray wolf to the tiny fennec fox. These animals have similar bodies: long noses, upright ears, sharp teeth, and bushy tails. Most live in groups, hunt together, and use scent and sounds to communicate. The domestic dog, a type of canid, has been our companion since ancient times.",
