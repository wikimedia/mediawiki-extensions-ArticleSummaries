	"summary": "Dysthymia is a type of depression that lasts for a long time, usually two years or more. It's not just a mild version of regular depression; it can be just as serious. People with dysthymia might feel sad, tired, and have trouble thinking clearly. They may not even realize they have it because they think it's just their personality. Now, it's officially called Persistent Depressive Disorder (PDD), which includes both long-term major depression and the old dysthymia.",
