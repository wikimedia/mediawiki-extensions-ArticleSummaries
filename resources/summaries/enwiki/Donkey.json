	"summary": "Donkeys, also known as asses, are domesticated animals that come from the African wild ass. They were first domesticated in Africa around 5,000 to 7,000 years ago and are mainly used as working animals. There are over 40 million donkeys worldwide, mostly in developing countries, where they carry heavy loads. In wealthier countries, some donkeys are kept as pets or for breeding. Adult males are called jacks, females are jennies, and young donkeys are foals. Jacks are often bred with horses to create mules.",
