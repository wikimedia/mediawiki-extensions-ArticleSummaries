She was said to be banished from the Garden of Eden for refusing to obey Adam. The name Lilith comes from Hebrew and Akkadian words associated with night creatures or spirits. Some religious texts, like the Babylonian Talmud, mention her, but others, like Maimonides, reject her existence. Today, Lilith appears in various forms of popular culture, inspiring stories, occult beliefs, and fantasy worlds.",
