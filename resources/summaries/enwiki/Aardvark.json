	"summary": "Aardvarks are unique animals native to Africa. They have long snouts like pigs, which help them find food, mainly ants and termites. These creatures live in burrows they dig with their strong claws and legs. Aardvarks are the only living species in their animal group, called Tubulidentata. They are related to elephants, manatees, and hyraxes. Although they are currently not at risk, their numbers are declining.",
