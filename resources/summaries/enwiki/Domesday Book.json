	"summary": "The Domesday Book is an ancient record of a survey of England and parts of Wales, ordered by King William the Conqueror in 1086. It was written in Latin and listed the king's properties and what people owed him. The book got its name later because its decisions were final, like the Last Judgment. It's now kept in London and can be viewed online. Historians use it to learn about life in medieval times, as it's one of the oldest and most detailed surveys of its kind.",
