	"summary": "Time is like a never-ending line of moments, moving from the past to the future. It's how we measure how long things last and how fast they change. We use time to organize events and understand the world around us. It's like a fourth dimension, adding to the three dimensions of space. Time is super important in science, religion, and philosophy, and it affects our daily lives and how we value our time on Earth.",
