	"summary": "Kublai Khan of the Yuan dynasty tried to conquer Japan in 1274 and 1281, but failed. These invasions are important in history because they stopped the Mongols from expanding further and are seen as key moments in Japan's past. Strong storms, called kamikaze (\"divine wind\"), helped Japan by destroying the Mongol fleets. The invasions also showed early use of gunpowder in battle, with hand-thrown bombs being a new technology at the time.",
