Originally, the Summer and Winter Games were in the same year, but they changed it so now they take place in alternate even-numbered years.\n\nThe Games have grown, adding new sports and countries. Some sports, like curling, have been removed and then brought back. The Winter Olympics have been held in 13 countries, mostly in the Northern Hemisphere. The United States is the only country to win a gold medal in every Winter Olympics.",
