	"summary": "This Supreme Court case (558 U.S. 310, 2010) ruled that the First Amendment allows corporations and organizations to spend money independently on political campaigns. The 5-4 decision lifted restrictions on how much money these groups could spend to support or oppose candidates.\n\nThe ruling was controversial. Supporters, like Senator Mitch McConnell, saw it as protecting free speech. Critics, including President Obama, argued it gave too much power to special interests, potentially undermining democracy. Justice Stevens' dissent reflected this concern.",
