This electricity can power homes, businesses, and even spaceships! Solar panels are often put together in groups, called arrays, and can be found on rooftops or in large solar farms.\n\nUsing solar energy has benefits like reducing pollution and saving money on electricity. However, it relies on sunny weather and can be expensive to set up. Despite this, solar power is a popular, clean energy choice for many.",
