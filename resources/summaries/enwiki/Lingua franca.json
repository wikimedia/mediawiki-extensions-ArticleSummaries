	"summary": "A lingua franca is a common language used by people who speak different native languages, especially for trade, diplomacy, or science. It's like a bridge that helps different groups communicate. For example, in the past, a language called Mediterranean Lingua Franca was used by traders in the Mediterranean region. Today, English is a global lingua franca, widely spoken and used for international communication. These languages make it easier for people from different cultures to understand each other.",
