	"summary": "Delphi was an ancient Greek sanctuary, famous for its oracle, Pythia. It was believed to be the center of the world, marked by the Omphalos stone. The name Delphi might come from a female serpent, Delphyne, killed by Apollo. Located on Mount Parnassus, it's now an archaeological site and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Many ancient Greek city-states built monuments here, showing their unity. The site is part of the beautiful Parnassos National Park.",
