The road covered over 4,000 miles, with many stops and different paths. Traders exchanged goods like silk, tea, and spices, and also shared ideas and religions. It was a dangerous journey with bandits and harsh lands. The Silk Road changed history by spreading technology and culture. Later, new trade routes were found, leading to global exploration. Today, some ancient routes are being revived as part of modern infrastructure projects.",
