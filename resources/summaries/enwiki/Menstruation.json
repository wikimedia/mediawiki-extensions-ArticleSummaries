The time between periods is 21 to 45 days. Bleeding lasts about 2 to 7 days.\n\nMost women don't have serious problems during their period. But some may experience symptoms like acne, mood changes, and heavy bleeding. If periods don't start by age 15 or stop for 90 days, it's important to talk to a doctor.",
