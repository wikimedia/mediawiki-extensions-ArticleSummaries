	"summary": "The Flag of Spain, called \"Bandera de Espa√±a,\" has three horizontal stripes: red, yellow, and red. The yellow stripe is twice as tall as each red stripe. It's also known as \"la Rojigualda.\" The flag's design comes from a naval ensign used in 1785 during King Charles III's rule. It was first used on ships and coastal areas but later became the official flag of Spain in 1843. The colors have stayed the same, except during the Second Republic (1931-1939). The only changes have been to the coat of arms on the flag.",
