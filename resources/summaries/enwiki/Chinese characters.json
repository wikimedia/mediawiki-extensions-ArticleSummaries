	"summary": "Chinese characters are a unique way to write languages, used for over 3000 years. Unlike alphabets, they represent words or meanings (morphemes) instead of sounds. These characters have evolved over time, starting as pictures and becoming more abstract.\n\nThe earliest characters were found on ancient bones. Over time, different styles developed, like seal script and clerical script. Today, simplified and traditional characters are used in different regions.\n\nChinese characters are also used in Japan (kanji), Korea (hanja), and Vietnam (chữ Hán), adapted to write local languages. They are made up of strokes, written in a specific order, and have been adapted for modern technologies like computers.",
