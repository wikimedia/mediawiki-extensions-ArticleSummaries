It led to the Holocaust, where millions of Jews were murdered.\n\nThe Nazis decided on this plan at a meeting in 1942. They tried other ideas first, like sending Jews to Madagascar or Palestine. But in the end, they built camps where they killed people in gas chambers. This happened mostly in Europe, where 2/3 of Jewish people were killed. It was a very sad and cruel time in history.",
