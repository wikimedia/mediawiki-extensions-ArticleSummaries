	"summary": "The Navajo Nation is a large area in the southwest U.S. where many Navajo people live. It's like a big home for them, covering parts of Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah. This reservation is the biggest in the country, even bigger than some states!\n\nIn 1868, the U.S. government created this land for the Navajo after the Mexican-American War. Over time, it grew larger, and now it has over 399,000 tribal members, making it the largest tribal group in the U.S. Many Navajo live here, but some also live in cities and other places across the country.",
