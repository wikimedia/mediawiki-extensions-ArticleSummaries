	"summary": "Lascaux is a system of caves in France, famous for its ancient wall paintings. These paintings, created around 17,000 to 22,000 years ago, depict large animals like those found in the area during the Upper Paleolithic period. The caves are located near Montignac in the Dordogne region. Due to their fragility, the original caves have been closed to visitors since 1963. However, replicas exist to showcase this remarkable prehistoric art, which is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Vézère Valley.",
