	"summary": "Halal is an Arabic word meaning \"permissible.\" In Islam, it refers to actions, foods, and items that are allowed. The opposite is haram, which means \"forbidden.\" Halal guidelines come from the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad's teachings.\n\nHalal is not just about food; it also covers finance, clothing, and behavior. Many businesses now get halal certification to show that their products are suitable for Muslims. This certification is important in the global halal market, especially in countries with large Muslim populations.",
