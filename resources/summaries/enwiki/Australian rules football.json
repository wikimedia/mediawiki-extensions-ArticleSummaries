Points are scored by kicking the ball between goal posts (6 points) or between a central and outer post (1 point). Players can move the ball by kicking, handballing, or running with it, but must bounce or touch the ball on the ground while running. Throwing is not allowed. The game originated in Melbourne in 1858 and has since become Australia's most popular sport, with the Australian Football League (AFL) being its top professional competition.",
