	"summary": "Time travel is the idea of moving between the past and future. It's a popular concept in science fiction books and movies, often done with a \"time machine.\" H.G. Wells made this idea famous in his book *The Time Machine*.\n\nWhile we can travel forward in time (getting older), traveling back in time is still just a theory. It might be possible with things like black holes, but it's very complicated and not yet understood. Scientists are still learning about time travel and if it can really happen.",
