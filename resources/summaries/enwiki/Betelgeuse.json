	"summary": "Betelgeuse, a red supergiant star in the Orion constellation, is usually the 10th brightest star in the night sky. It's huge, with a radius over 600 times that of the Sun, and would engulf Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars if placed at the center of our solar system. Its brightness varies, and it's expected to explode as a supernova within 100,000 years, shining as bright as the half-moon for months. In 2019-2020, Betelgeuse dimmed significantly due to dust ejected from the star, but it has since brightened again.",
