	"summary": "Stoicism is an ancient Greek philosophy that teaches how to live a good life. It was started by Zeno of Citium around 300 BC. Stoics believe that being brave, wise, and fair (virtues) is the key to happiness. They think that things like money and health are not as important as being a good person. Stoics try to control their emotions and make good choices. This helps them handle tough situations. Many famous people, like the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, followed Stoic ideas. Even today, people still study and practice Stoicism.",
