	"summary": "Cursive handwriting, like the old-fashioned American Spencerian script, is a way of writing where letters are joined together to make writing faster. It's used in many languages and can be formal or casual. Cursive can be \"looped,\" \"italic,\" or \"connected,\" and sometimes letters in a word are all linked, creating one long stroke. While it's thought to speed up writing, very fancy styles can actually be slower to write.",
