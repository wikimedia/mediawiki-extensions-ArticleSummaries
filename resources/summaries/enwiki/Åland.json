	"summary": "Åland is a special region of Finland, with its own government and rules. It's very small, made up of one main island and thousands of tiny ones in the Baltic Sea. Most people there speak Swedish. Åland became its own region in 1920, and it doesn't have a military, which means it's very peaceful. It's located near Sweden and Finland, and you can get there by ferry.",
