	"summary": "A caliphate is a type of monarchy in the Islamic world, where a leader called a caliph rules. It started in 7th-century Arabia and was inspired by the leadership of the Prophet Muhammad. There have been several major caliphates, like the Rashidun, Umayyad, and Abbasid, which were powerful empires. The Ottoman Empire also had a caliphate until it was ended in 1924.\n\nDifferent Islamic groups have different ideas about who should be a caliph. Sunnis believe in election, while Shias think it should be a religious leader chosen by God. Some modern groups have tried to revive the caliphate, but these claims are not widely accepted.",
