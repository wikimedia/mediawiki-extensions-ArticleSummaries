	"summary": "Psoriasis is a long-term skin condition that isn't contagious. It causes red, dry, and scaly patches on the skin, which can be itchy. There are different types, like plaque psoriasis (the most common) and guttate psoriasis (with drop-shaped lesions). It can affect fingernails and toenails, too.\n\nPsoriasis is likely caused by a mix of genetic and environmental factors. It often starts in adulthood and affects both men and women equally. There's no cure, but treatments like creams, light therapy, and medicines can help manage the symptoms.",
