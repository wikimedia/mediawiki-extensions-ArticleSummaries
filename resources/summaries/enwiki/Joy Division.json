	"summary": "Joy Division was an English post-punk band formed in 1976. The band members were Ian Curtis (vocals), Bernard Sumner (guitar), Peter Hook (bass), and Stephen Morris (drums). They made a unique, sparse sound and were one of the first post-punk bands. Their debut album, *Unknown Pleasures*, was released in 1979. Curtis struggled with health issues and died by suicide in 1980, just before the band's first U.S. tour. Their second album, *Closer*, was released after his death. The remaining members formed a new band, New Order, who were also successful. Both bands were nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2023.",
