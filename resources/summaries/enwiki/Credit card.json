	"summary": "Credit cards are a popular payment method, allowing users to buy items or borrow money with the promise to repay later. They are issued by banks and differ from charge cards, as you don't need to pay the full balance each month. Instead, you can keep a running debt, but you'll be charged interest.\n\nUnlike debit cards, credit cards involve a bank lending money to the cardholder. As of 2018, there were billions of credit cards globally, with the U.S. having over 1 billion in circulation by 2020.",
