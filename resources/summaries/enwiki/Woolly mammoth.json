	"summary": "The woolly mammoth was a large, extinct animal related to elephants. It lived during the ice age and had long tusks and thick fur to survive the cold. They ate grass and lived in herds across Europe and North America. Early humans hunted mammoths and used their bones and tusks for tools and art. The last mammoths died out around 4,000 years ago on a remote island. Scientists have studied their DNA and even considered trying to bring them back, but this is not possible yet.",
