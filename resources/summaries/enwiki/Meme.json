	"summary": "A meme is an idea or behavior that spreads across a culture, like a catchy song or a popular trend. It can be a joke, a phrase, or even a way of doing something. Memes are like cultural genes, passing from person to person through imitation. They can evolve and change, just like biological organisms.\n\nThe concept of memes was introduced by Richard Dawkins, suggesting that they self-replicate and mutate, similar to genes. This idea has sparked debates among scientists and social scientists about whether memes can be studied scientifically. Some argue that memes are a useful way to understand cultural evolution, while others criticize the idea of treating culture as a biological entity.",
