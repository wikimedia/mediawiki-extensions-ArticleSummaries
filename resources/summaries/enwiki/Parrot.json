	"summary": "Parrots are colorful birds with strong beaks, found mostly in tropical areas. They are very smart and can copy human speech, making them popular pets. There are over 400 parrot species, and many are at risk of disappearing. They eat mostly plants and nest in trees. People often capture parrots for pets, which hurts their wild populations. Parrots are unique in how they move, using their necks and beaks to climb like a third leg.",
