	"summary": "The Tea Party movement, which started in 2009, was a group of American conservatives who wanted smaller government and lower taxes. They opposed President Obama's policies, especially his healthcare law. The movement got its name from the Boston Tea Party, an event from the American Revolution. It began after a TV reporter, Rick Santelli, talked about a \"tea party\" on a stock exchange floor. The Tea Party supported many Republican candidates and helped them win more seats in Congress in 2010. By 2016, some said the movement had faded, but its ideas still influence the Republican Party.",
