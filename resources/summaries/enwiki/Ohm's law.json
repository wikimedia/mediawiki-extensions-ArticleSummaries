	"summary": "Ohm's law describes how electricity flows through a material. It states that the amount of electric current (I) flowing through a conductor is directly related to the voltage (V) applied across it, and this relationship is defined by the resistance (R) of the material. The law is named after Georg Ohm, who discovered it. This law helps us understand how different materials conduct electricity and is used in many areas of physics and engineering.",
