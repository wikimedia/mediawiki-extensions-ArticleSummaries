	"summary": "The Antonov An-225 was a massive cargo plane designed in the Soviet Union. It was built to carry large spacecraft and had the biggest wingspan of any operational aircraft. Only one was fully made, with a second one partially built. After being used in the Soviet space program, it was later refurbished for commercial use, transporting huge items like generators and wind turbines. Unfortunately, the one completed An-225 was destroyed during the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. There are plans to finish the second one to replace it.",
