	"summary": "Weasels are small, active meat-eating mammals belonging to the \"weasel family\" (Mustelidae), which also includes badgers and otters. They have long, thin bodies and short legs. The least weasel, the smallest carnivore in the world, is often what people mean when they say \"weasel.\" These tiny weasels hunt other small animals and can even fit into burrows to chase their prey. Though sometimes seen as pests for taking chickens or rabbits, they also help control rodent populations. They live in many parts of the world, including Europe, North America, Asia, and South America.",
