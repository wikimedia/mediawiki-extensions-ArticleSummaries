	"summary": "## Ideal Gas Law\n\nThe ideal gas law describes how pressure, volume, and temperature of a gas are related. It's like a recipe for gases:\n\n* **Pressure × Volume = Temperature × Number of gas particles × Constant**\n\nImagine isotherms as curved lines on a graph showing this relationship. Higher temperatures make the lines move away from the bottom left corner. This law works well for most gases, but it's not perfect. It was first figured out by scientists combining different gas laws in 1834.",
