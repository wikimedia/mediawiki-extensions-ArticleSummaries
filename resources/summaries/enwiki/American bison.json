	"summary": "The American bison, often called the American buffalo, is a large mammal native to North America. They used to live across a huge area, from Alaska to Mexico and the Atlantic coast. There are two types: the plains bison, smaller with a rounded hump, and the larger wood bison with a square hump.\n\nIn the 1800s, hunting and disease almost wiped out the bison. Their population dropped from millions to just 541 by 1889. Efforts to save them began in the 1900s, and now there are around 31,000 wild bison. They are no longer just in national parks but can be found in various regions of the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and even Russia. Bison are important to Native American culture and are the national mammal of the U.S.",
