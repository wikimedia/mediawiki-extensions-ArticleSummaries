	"summary": "Tashkent, Uzbekistan's capital, is a bustling metropolis with over 3 million people. It has a rich history dating back to the 8th century, influenced by Sogdian, Turkic, and Islamic cultures. The city flourished as a Silk Road hub but faced destruction by Genghis Khan. Later, it became an independent city-state, was reconquered, and eventually fell to the Russian Empire in 1865.\n\nUnder Soviet rule, Tashkent grew significantly, but a devastating earthquake in 1966 led to its rebuilding. Today, it is a diverse city, celebrating its 2,200-year history, with Uzbeks as the majority ethnic group.",
