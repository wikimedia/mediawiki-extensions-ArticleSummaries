	"summary": "In the UK, undergraduate degrees are graded as either honours or ordinary. Honours degrees have four classes: First, 2:1, 2:2, and Third, based on marks. Integrated master's degrees are similar. The system, started in 1918, recognizes academic success beyond exams.\n\nRecently, there's been concern about grade inflation, with more students getting top marks. This makes it harder for employers to judge candidates. Also, students feel pressure to do extra activities to stand out. The system is being reviewed as it affects future study and job chances.",
