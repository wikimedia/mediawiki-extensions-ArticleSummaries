	"summary": "Rabies is a serious disease caused by viruses that affects the brain. It's often called \"hydrophobia\" because people with rabies may fear water. Symptoms include fever, nausea, and violent movements. Once symptoms start, it's usually fatal.\n\nYou can get rabies from an infected animal's bite or saliva. Dogs are the main carriers globally, but in some places, bats are a bigger risk.\n\nThere's no cure, but vaccines can prevent it if given before symptoms appear. Washing animal bites with soap and water can also help. Rabies kills around 59,000 people worldwide each year, mostly in Africa and Asia.",
