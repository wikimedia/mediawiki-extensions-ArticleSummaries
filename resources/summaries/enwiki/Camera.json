They work by controlling how much light enters and hitting a sensor or special film. There are many kinds of cameras: some are tiny and easy to carry, others are big for super-detailed photos. Some let you see exactly what you're shooting, while others use two different parts for looking and capturing.\n\nToday, most people use smartphones to take pictures, but special cameras still exist for professional photographers and movies.",
