	"summary": "Antibiotics are special medicines that fight bacteria. They can kill or stop bacteria from growing, helping our bodies fight infections. These drugs are really important when we're sick with things like strep throat or pneumonia. \n\nPeople have used early forms of antibiotics for a long time, like using moldy bread to treat wounds. But modern antibiotics, like penicillin, were discovered in the 20th century. Today, we use them to keep us healthy, but we have to be careful not to use them too much, as some bacteria are becoming resistant to them.",
