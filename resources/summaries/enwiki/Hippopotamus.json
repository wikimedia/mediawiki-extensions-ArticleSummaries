Hippos look like big, hairless horses with large teeth. They live in groups led by a male, called a bull. These groups spend the day in water to stay cool and come out to eat grass at night. Hippos are dangerous due to their aggressive behavior. They are in danger because of habitat loss and hunting for their teeth, which are made of ivory.",
