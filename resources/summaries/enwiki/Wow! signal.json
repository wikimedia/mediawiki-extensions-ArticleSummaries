	"summary": "The Wow! signal was a strong radio message from space detected in 1977 by a telescope in Ohio, USA. It seemed to come from the constellation Sagittarius. Astronomer Jerry Ehman found the signal while checking data and wrote \"Wow!\" next to it, hence the name. The signal lasted for 72 seconds but hasn't been heard since. Scientists are still trying to figure out where it came from, whether it's from nature, or if it was made by humans.",
