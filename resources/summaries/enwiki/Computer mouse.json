	"summary": "A computer mouse is a device used to control the cursor on a computer screen. It usually has two buttons (left and right) and a scroll wheel. The mouse detects movement when you move it across a surface, translating this into cursor movement on the screen. This helps you interact with the computer easily. Modern mice often use light instead of moving parts to track movement and can connect wirelessly to computers. They may also have extra features like touch surfaces for additional control.",
