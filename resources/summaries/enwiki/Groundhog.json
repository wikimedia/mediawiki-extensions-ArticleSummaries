	"summary": "The groundhog, also called a woodchuck, is a large squirrel-like rodent found across North America. It lives in low-lying areas and is known for digging burrows, which help keep the soil healthy. These animals are smart and social. They communicate using whistles, care for their young, and work together to dig their homes. Carl Linnaeus first described this species in 1758. Groundhogs are important for their environment, acting as habitat engineers.",
