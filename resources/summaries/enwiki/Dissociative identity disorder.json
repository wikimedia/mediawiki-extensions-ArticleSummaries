	"summary": "DID is a mental health condition where a person has two or more different personalities or states. It's often linked to traumatic events in early childhood, like abuse or neglect. People with DID may forget important things that happened to them. This disorder is more common in women but can affect men too. It's treated with therapy, and sometimes medicine for other problems that might come with it. About 1-2% of people have DID, but it's hard to know the exact number.",
