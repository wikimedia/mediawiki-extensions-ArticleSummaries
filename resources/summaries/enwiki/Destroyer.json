	"summary": "A destroyer is a fast and versatile warship designed to protect larger ships. They were first created to fight torpedo boats and evolved to become powerful missile-armed vessels. Modern destroyers, like the USS Arleigh Burke, are huge, weighing up to 9,600 tons. They can operate independently and carry powerful weapons, even nuclear missiles. \n\nWhile some navies call them frigates, destroyers are now the most common surface warships, replacing battleships and cruisers. They play a crucial role in today's naval forces.",
