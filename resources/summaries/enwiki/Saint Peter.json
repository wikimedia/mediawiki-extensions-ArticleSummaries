According to tradition, Peter was crucified in Rome. He is considered a major saint by many Christian churches. In the New Testament, he is often called Simon Peter or Cephas. Peter and his brother Andrew were fishermen. Some books in the Bible, like 1st and 2nd Peter, are traditionally thought to be written by him, but this is debated by scholars.",
