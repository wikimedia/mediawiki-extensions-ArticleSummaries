	"summary": "Pantheism is a belief that thinks the universe and nature are the same as a divine or supreme being. It sees the whole universe as one big god, with every star and planet being a part of this god. Pantheists don't believe in a personal god who looks like a human. This idea has been around for thousands of years and can be found in many different religions. The word \"pantheism\" was first used in the late 1600s, and it was made popular by a philosopher named Baruch Spinoza. In Eastern religions like Hinduism and Taoism, there are also pantheistic ideas.",
