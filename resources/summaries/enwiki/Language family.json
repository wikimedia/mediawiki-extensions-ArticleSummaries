	"summary": "A language family is a group of languages that come from the same ancient language, like how siblings have the same parents. These languages change over time as people move to different places and speak differently. For example, Spanish, French, and Italian are in the Romance language family because they all come from Latin.\n\nWe can tell languages are related by looking at how their sounds and words change in similar ways. But sometimes, languages can seem related just because people have been using them together, not because they have the same origin.\n\nSome language families have just a few languages, while others, like Austronesian, have over 1000!",
