	"summary": "Wine is a drink made by turning sweet fruit, usually grapes, into alcohol. Yeast eats the fruit's sugar, creating ethanol and carbon dioxide. Many fruits can be used, but grape wine is the most common. Different grapes and yeast types make various wine styles. The climate where grapes grow and how wine is made also affect the taste.\n\nWine has been around for thousands of years and is important in many religions. The top wine-making countries are Italy, France, Spain, the U.S., and Australia.",
