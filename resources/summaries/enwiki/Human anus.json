Two muscles, one we control and one automatic, control the anus' opening and closing. The area above the anus is called the perineum. The anus can have health problems like hemorrhoids and infections, and it can also be involved in sexual activity, though this is controversial and illegal in some places. Anal sex can spread diseases like HIV.",
