	"summary": "The Apollo program, led by NASA, aimed to land humans on the Moon. It began in the 1960s, following Project Mercury. President John F. Kennedy's challenge to reach the Moon was met on Apollo 11 in 1969 when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walked on the lunar surface. Six missions successfully landed astronauts on the Moon, with twelve people achieving this feat.\n\nThe program faced challenges, including a fatal fire during Apollo 1. Despite budget cuts, it paved the way for future space exploration, returning lunar rocks to Earth and advancing technology. Apollo's legacy includes the Skylab space station and the Apolloâ€“Soyuz Test Project.",
