	"summary": "Avoidant personality disorder (AvPD) is a mental health condition where people feel extremely shy and have intense fear of being judged or rejected by others. They often avoid social situations and relationships because they believe they are not good enough. This can lead to loneliness and isolation, even though they really want to connect with people. AvPD can happen to anyone, regardless of their background, but it's more common in those who experienced rejection or neglect as children.",
