The dish originated in the early 20th century in Yokohama, inspired by Chinese noodle dishes. After World War II, ramen became even more popular in Japan due to food shortages. Now, it's a cultural favorite with many regional styles, like miso ramen in Sapporo and tonkotsu ramen in Hakata. Instant ramen, invented in 1958, made the dish famous worldwide.",
