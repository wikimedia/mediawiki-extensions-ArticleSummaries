	"summary": "Money is something widely accepted to buy things or pay debts. It can be in the form of banknotes, coins, or digital bank money. Historically, money had value as a commodity, but now most countries use fiat money, which has no intrinsic value. Instead, its worth is decided by the government, making it legal tender.\n\nThe money supply includes all physical currency and bank money, like the balances in your checking or savings account. Bank money is the most significant part of a country's total money, allowing for easy transactions without physical cash.",
