	"summary": "Cannibalism is when humans eat other humans, and it has a long history. Ancient humans, like Neanderthals, practiced it, and it was seen in many cultures worldwide. Some tribes, like the Island Caribs, were known for this, but there's debate about how common it really was.\n\nIn tough times, like famines, people might turn to cannibalism as a last resort. It's also been linked to medical beliefs in Europe, where people consumed body parts for health reasons. Sadly, it still happens in some places, like Papua New Guinea, and during wars in Liberia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.",
