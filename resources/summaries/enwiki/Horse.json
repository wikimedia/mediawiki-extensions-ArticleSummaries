	"summary": "Horses are large, domesticated mammals with a long history alongside humans. They evolved from small, multi-toed creatures over millions of years. Humans started domesticating them around 6,000 years ago. Horses are known for their speed, balance, and quick reactions. They can sleep standing up or lying down, which is unique. Female horses, called mares, give birth to foals after 11 months. Domesticated horses are trained for various tasks, like riding or pulling carts, and come in many breeds with different traits. People use horses for sports, work, and even special therapies.",
