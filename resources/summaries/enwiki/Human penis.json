The body contains three columns of tissue, with the urethra running through the middle one. During sexual excitement, the penis can become erect, growing in size and stiffness. Erections can also happen when not sexually aroused, especially during adolescence and sleep. The average erect penis length is just over 5 inches. Some people choose to modify their penises with circumcision or piercings.",
