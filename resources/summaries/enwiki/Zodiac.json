	"summary": "The zodiac is a special area in the sky, like a belt, where the Sun, Moon, and bright planets move. It's divided into 12 parts, called signs, each 30 degrees apart. These signs have names like Aries, Taurus, and Gemini. People use the zodiac to mark time and seasons. It started with the Babylonians over 2000 years ago and spread to Greek and Hindu cultures. Today, astronomers still use this system to track planets in our solar system.",
