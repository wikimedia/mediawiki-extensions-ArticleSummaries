	"summary": "The platypus is a unique mammal found in Australia and Tasmania. It lays eggs, has a duck-like bill, and a beaver-like tail. This creature confused early scientists who thought it was a fake animal! Platypuses can sense prey in water using electricity, and males have a venomous spur on their feet. They are important in understanding evolution and are considered a symbol of Australia. Although not currently in serious danger, habitat loss and pollution could make them vulnerable.",
