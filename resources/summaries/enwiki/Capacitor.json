	"summary": "A capacitor is an electrical component that stores energy. It has two conductive plates separated by an insulator (dielectric). When voltage is applied, one plate gains positive charge, and the other gains negative charge. This creates an electric field. Capacitors are used in many devices to:\n\n- Block direct current (DC) but allow alternating current (AC).\n- Smooth out power supplies.\n- Tune radios to specific frequencies.\n- Stabilize voltage in power transmission.\n\nThey were first made in the 1740s using water-filled jars. Today, they come in various types and are essential in electronics.",
