	"summary": "The Israelites were an ancient group of people who lived in the land of Canaan, now part of Israel and Palestine. They spoke a language called Hebrew and were made up of twelve tribes, each descended from one of Jacob's sons. According to the Bible, they were led out of slavery in Egypt by Moses and then conquered Canaan under Joshua. Over time, they formed two kingdoms: Israel and Judah. These kingdoms were later conquered by other empires, but some Israelites returned to their homeland. Today, Jews and Samaritans trace their history back to the ancient Israelites.",
