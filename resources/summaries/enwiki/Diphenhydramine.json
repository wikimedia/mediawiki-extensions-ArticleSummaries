	"summary": "Diphenhydramine, often known as Benadryl, is a common medicine used to treat allergies, cold symptoms, and insomnia. It was created in 1946 and is now available as a generic drug. This medication works by blocking histamine's effects, which causes drowsiness and relieves allergy symptoms. It can be taken in various ways, and its effects last for a few hours.\n\nSide effects might include sleepiness and stomach issues. It's not suitable for young children or the elderly. While it's generally safe during pregnancy, breastfeeding mothers should avoid it. Some people also use it recreationally due to its sedative properties.",
