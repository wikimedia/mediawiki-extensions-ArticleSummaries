Founded in 1701, it grew to be the 4th largest U.S. city by 1920 due to auto industry growth. The Detroit River, a key feature, was a busy trade route. However, Detroit faced urban decay from the mid-20th century due to job losses and suburbanization, leading to a population decline. It filed for bankruptcy in 2013 but has since recovered. Today, Detroit is a diverse cultural center, famous for music genres like Motown and techno, and its architecture. It's also a significant port and transportation hub.",
