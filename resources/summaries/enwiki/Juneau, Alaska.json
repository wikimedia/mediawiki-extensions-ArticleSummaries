	"summary": "Juneau is the capital of Alaska, named after a gold prospector, Joe Juneau. It's unique because it's not connected by road to the rest of the U.S., due to the rugged terrain. The city is surrounded by mountains and glaciers, with the Mendenhall Glacier being a popular sight. Juneau became the capital in 1906, and later merged with nearby areas to form a large municipality. It has a population of around 32,000 people, but during cruise ship season, the population nearly doubles. The Alaska State Capitol building, built in 1931, is located in downtown Juneau.",
