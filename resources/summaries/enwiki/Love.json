	"summary": "Love is a strong feeling of care and attraction towards someone or something. It can be between family, friends, romantic partners, or even for activities and animals. Ancient Greek philosophers believed there were six types of love, like familial love and romantic love. Modern ideas add more, like unrequited love or self-love. Love helps build relationships and is a popular theme in art. It's hard to define because it means different things to different people and can be both good (kindness, compassion) and bad (selfishness).",
