	"summary": "A volcano is like a hole in the Earth's surface, allowing hot lava, ash, and gases to escape from deep within. They often form where tectonic plates meet, like the edges of the Pacific Ocean, where plates collide or move apart. Volcanoes can also appear where the Earth's crust stretches thin. These powerful forces can cause dramatic changes, even affecting the planet's temperature and causing famines. Other planets, like Venus, also have volcanoes.",
