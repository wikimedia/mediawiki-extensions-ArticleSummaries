This system encourages people to work hard, be creative, and spend money on what they want.\n\nIt started in Europe a long time ago, during the Industrial Revolution. Now, most countries have a mix of capitalism and government control. Sometimes, there are ups and downs in the economy, but capitalism keeps growing and changing.",
