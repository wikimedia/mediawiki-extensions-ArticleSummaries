	"summary": "A QR code is a special kind of barcode that looks like a square with black and white patterns. It was first made in Japan in 1994 to label car parts. QR codes can hold more information than regular barcodes, like web links, tracking data, and even text in different languages. They're used everywhere now for things like tracking products, identifying items, and marketing. Devices like phones and cameras can read these codes quickly and easily.",
