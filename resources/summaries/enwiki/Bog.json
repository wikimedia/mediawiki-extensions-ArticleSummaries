	"summary": "A bog is a special type of wetland that forms in cool, northern places. It's like a big, spongy area filled with dead plants, mostly a moss called sphagnum. Bogs are often found in old lake basins where the water doesn't drain well. They get most of their water from rain, which makes them acidic and low in nutrients. This slow growth and decay process creates a carbon sink, which is good for the environment. Bogs are home to unique plants, animals, and fungi, making them important for biodiversity.",
