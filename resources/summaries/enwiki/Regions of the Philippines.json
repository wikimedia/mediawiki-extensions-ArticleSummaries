	"summary": "The Philippines is divided into 18 regions to help manage government services. These regions are like big groups that make it easier to plan and provide services across different cities and provinces. Each region has a center where important government offices are located. Most regions are run by a council appointed by the president, but one region, Bangsamoro, has its own elected government with special powers. This system helps the national government work more efficiently across the country.",
