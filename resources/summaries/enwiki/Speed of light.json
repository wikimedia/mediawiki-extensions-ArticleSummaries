	"summary": "The speed of light in a vacuum is a constant: 299,792,458 meters per second. It's the fastest speed anything can travel in the universe. Light, electromagnetic waves, and massless particles move at this speed. Einstein's theory of relativity shows that this speed is the same for all observers, no matter how fast they are moving.\n\nWhile light seems instant, it takes time to travel long distances. This fact is crucial in astronomy and technology, like communicating with space probes. In everyday materials, light travels slower, depending on the material's refractive index.",
