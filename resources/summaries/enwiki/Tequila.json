	"summary": "Tequila is a popular drink made from the blue agave plant, mainly grown in the area around the city of Tequila in Mexico. The unique red soil there is perfect for these plants. Over 300 million agave plants are harvested each year. The highland-grown agaves are bigger and sweeter, while those from the valley have a more grassy taste. Tequila production is protected by Mexican law and recognized internationally. It's stronger than many other drinks, with an alcohol content between 35% and 55%. People often drink it straight in Mexico, but worldwide, it's commonly served as a shot with salt and lime.",
