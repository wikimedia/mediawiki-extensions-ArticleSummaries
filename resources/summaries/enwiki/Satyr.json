	"summary": "In Greek mythology, a satyr is a male nature spirit with horse-like ears and tail, and human legs. They love wine, music, and women, and are often shown as ugly and naked. Satyrs were companions of the god Dionysus and lived in remote places. They were known for their funny but obscene behavior. Over time, satyrs became more human-like and were sometimes mixed up with goat-like creatures called Pans. The Romans called them fauns. Today, satyrs are often tamer and appear in fantasy stories for kids.",
