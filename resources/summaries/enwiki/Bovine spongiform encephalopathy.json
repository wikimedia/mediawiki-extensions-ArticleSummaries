	"summary": "Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), or \"mad cow disease,\" is a deadly brain disease in cows. It's caused by a tiny protein called a prion. Cows get it from eating infected meat or bone meal, often from other cows or sheep with similar diseases. Symptoms include weird behavior, walking problems, and weight loss. It can take years for symptoms to show, and once they do, the cow dies within weeks to months. Rarely, it can spread to people and cause a similar disease called vCJD. To prevent BSE, many countries have strict rules about what cows can eat and which parts can be used for food. The UK had a big problem with BSE in the 1980s and 1990s but has mostly eradicated it now.",
