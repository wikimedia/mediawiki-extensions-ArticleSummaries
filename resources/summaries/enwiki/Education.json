	"summary": "Education is how we learn and grow. It's about passing on knowledge, skills, and values. There are different types: formal (in schools), non-formal (structured but outside school), and informal (everyday learning). Education helps us become good citizens and prepares us for jobs, boosting the economy.\n\nIt's more than just school; it's about how we think and act. Governments and organizations like UNESCO help make sure everyone gets a good education. Motivation, intelligence, and social factors all play a part in how well we learn. Studying education helps us understand how to make it better.",
