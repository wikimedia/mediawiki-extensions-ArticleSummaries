	"summary": "Tin is a soft, silvery metal with the symbol Sn. It's found in nature as cassiterite and is the 49th most abundant element on Earth. Tin has two common forms: a shiny, malleable one at room temperature, and a less dense, gray form at low temperatures. It doesn't easily rust.\n\nTin was first used in bronze (a mix of tin and copper) around 3000 BC. Today, it's used in many alloys, like solders and pewter. It's also used to coat steel to prevent rusting, like in \"tin cans.\" Some tin compounds can be harmful, but metallic tin is generally safe.",
