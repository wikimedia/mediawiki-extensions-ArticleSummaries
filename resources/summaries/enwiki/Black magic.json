	"summary": "Black magic is the use of supernatural powers for bad or selfish reasons. It has a complicated history with religion. Sometimes, religious figures have even practiced black magic, like a 17th-century priest who performed a Black Mass. A book called \"The Book of Ceremonial Magic\" explains many black magic practices. Today, popular culture includes different ideas under black magic, like Satanism. Black magic involves calling on demons or spirits, but it's not the same as worshipping them, which is often what people believed in the Middle Ages.",
