	"summary": "A Caesarean section (C-section) is a surgical way to deliver a baby. It's done by making a cut in the mother's belly and uterus. This method is used when vaginal birth might be risky for the mom or baby. Reasons include problems with labor, twin pregnancy, high blood pressure, or issues with the placenta.\n\nThe surgery takes about an hour and can be done while the mother is awake or asleep. Recovery takes around six weeks, and there are small risks of complications. It's recommended only when medically needed. Globally, about 23 million C-sections are performed each year.",
