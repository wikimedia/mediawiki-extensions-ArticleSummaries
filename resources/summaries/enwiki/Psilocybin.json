	"summary": "Psilocybin, found in over 200 mushroom species, is a naturally occurring compound that doesn't affect the brain directly. Instead, it turns into psilocin in our bodies, causing feelings of happiness, seeing things that aren't there, and changing how we perceive the world. It can also make people feel sick or have panic attacks.\n\nPeople have used psilocybin mushrooms for thousands of years, even before written history. They were important in spiritual ceremonies in ancient Mexico. In the 1950s, a scientist named Albert Hofmann discovered psilocybin, and it was used in medical research. However, strict drug laws stopped much of this research, and using psilocybin mushrooms is now illegal in most countries.",
