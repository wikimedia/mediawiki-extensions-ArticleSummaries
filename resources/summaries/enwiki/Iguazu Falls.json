	"summary": "Iguazú Falls, on the border of Argentina and Brazil, are the world's largest waterfall system. The Iguazu River, which starts near Curitiba, Brazil, flows through both countries. Most of the falls are in Argentina. The name Iguazú means \"big water\" in the Guarani language. A legend says a god created the falls when a woman ran away with her human lover. The Spanish explorer Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca first wrote about the falls in 1541. UNESCO recognized them as a World Heritage site in 2013.",
