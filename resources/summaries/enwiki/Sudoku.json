	"summary": "Sudoku is a popular puzzle game where you fill a 9x9 grid with numbers from 1 to 9. The challenge is to make sure each row, column, and small square (called a \"box\") has all the numbers once. It started as \"Number Place\" in the 19th century but became famous as Sudoku in Japan in 1986. It spread to the US and the UK in 2004, thanks to a computer program that could create unique puzzles quickly.",
