	"summary": "Arianism is a belief about Jesus Christ's nature, named after Arius, a priest from Egypt. Arians thought Jesus was the Son of God, but not equal to God the Father. They said Jesus had a beginning, unlike God, and was created by God. This idea was seen as wrong by many Christians who believed in the Trinity, where God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are one. The first Christian councils agreed, calling Arianism a heresy. Most Christians didn't fully understand the complex ideas, but the debate was important in early Christian history.",
