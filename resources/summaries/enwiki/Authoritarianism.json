	"summary": "Authoritarianism is a type of government where one person or a small group has complete control. They don't allow different political ideas and try to keep things the same. This means less freedom for people and less democracy.\n\nThere are different kinds of authoritarian governments, like those run by one person (autocratic) or a small group (oligarchic). They might control elections and not let the opposition win. Some countries might look democratic but are really controlled by a small group.\n\nThe number of these governments increased after World War II but started to decrease in the 1970s. Recently, some democratic leaders have become authoritarian.",
