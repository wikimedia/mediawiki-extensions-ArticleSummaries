	"summary": "Poseidon was a powerful god in ancient Greek mythology, ruling over the sea, storms, and earthquakes. He was often linked to horses and was known as the \"earth shaker.\" Homer's *Iliad* describes him supporting the Greeks in the Trojan War. In the *Odyssey*, Poseidon causes trouble for Odysseus after he blinds the Cyclops, Polyphemus.\n\nPoseidon competed with other gods to be the patron of cities. He was known for his temper and could cause floods when angry. Some believe he originated with the Pelasgians or Minyans, but he was widely worshipped by all Greeks.",
