	"summary": "Circumcision is a surgery to remove the skin covering the tip of the penis, called the foreskin. It's often done for medical reasons, like preventing infections, or as a religious or cultural tradition. Doctors use special tools and numbing medicine to make it less painful.\n\nThis procedure is very common worldwide and has a long history, especially in Judaism and Islam. Some believe it has health benefits, but others think the risks might outweigh these advantages, especially for newborns. Complications are rare but can happen.",
