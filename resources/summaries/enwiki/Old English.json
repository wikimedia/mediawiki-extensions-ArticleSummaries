	"summary": "Old English, also known as Anglo-Saxon, was spoken in England and Scotland during the Middle Ages. It came from the languages of Anglo-Saxon settlers who arrived in the 5th century. This language evolved into Middle English and Early Scots after the Norman Conquest in 1066.\n\nOld English had four main dialects, with West Saxon becoming the literary standard. It was related to Old Frisian and Old Saxon and was very different from Modern English. The language had complex grammar with many inflectional endings, allowing for flexible word order. Early writings used a runic system, later replaced by the Latin alphabet.",
