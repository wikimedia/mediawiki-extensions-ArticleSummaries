	"summary": "In the 1980s, Yugoslavia faced troubles. After leader Josip Broz Tito died in 1980, the country had economic and political issues. Tensions rose between different ethnic groups, especially in Kosovo. Slobodan Milošević took power in Serbia and wanted more control, which caused conflict with other republics like Slovenia and Croatia.\n\nIn 1990, new elections led to ethnic separatist parties winning, except in Serbia and Montenegro. This caused the Yugoslav Wars, mostly in Bosnia and Herzegovina, leaving long-lasting damage. In 1992, Serbia and Montenegro formed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, officially ending the old Yugoslavia.",
