	"summary": "BDD is a mental health condition where people are extremely worried about their appearance. They might focus on a small flaw or imagine one that isn't there. This worry takes up a lot of their time and causes a lot of stress. It can start in teens and affect daily life, making it hard to go to school or work. People with BDD might also feel very lonely and think about hurting themselves. It's important to get help from a doctor if you or someone you know has these feelings.",
