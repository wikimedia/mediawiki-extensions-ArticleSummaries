	"summary": "In biology, a kingdom is a big group of living things, ranking just below a domain. Kingdoms are further divided into smaller groups called phyla. Traditionally, there were six kingdoms (Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Protista, Archaea, and Bacteria) in North American textbooks, but other countries used five kingdoms. Recently, some scientists have stopped using the term \"kingdom\" because not all groups are related in the same way. Instead, they use terms like flora (plants), fauna (animals), and funga (fungi) to describe life in a specific area.",
