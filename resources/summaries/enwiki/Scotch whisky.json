Distilleries must age it in oak barrels for at least three years. The youngest whisky in a bottle determines its age statement. Scotch comes in five types: single malt, single grain, blended malt, blended grain, and blended. Many people call a serving a \"dram.\" The name means \"water of life\" in Gaelic.",
