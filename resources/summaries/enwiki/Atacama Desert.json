	"summary": "The Atacama Desert, found in northern Chile, is the world's driest non-polar desert. It's incredibly dry due to the mountains around it blocking any rain. This desert is so unique it's used to test equipment for Mars missions! Stretching over 1,000 miles, it's a vast, foggy plateau created by the meeting of the Andes and the Chilean Coast Range. These mountains, along with ocean currents, make the area extremely dry.",
