	"summary": "Industrial pollution happens when companies don't think about how their actions affect the environment. The \"tragedy of the commons\" is an idea that explains how people can use up or ruin valuable resources, like land or water, if they all have access to it without rules. This concept was made famous by ecologist Garrett Hardin in 1968. Some people disagree with Hardin's ideas, saying that it's not always inevitable and that people can work together to protect resources. Others criticize his views on overpopulation as too simple and unfair.",
