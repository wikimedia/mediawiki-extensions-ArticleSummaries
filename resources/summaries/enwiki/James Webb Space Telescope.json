	"summary": "The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a powerful infrared telescope in space. It's the biggest telescope ever launched, with a mirror six times larger than the Hubble Telescope's. This allows it to see very distant and old objects in the universe.\n\nJWST was designed by NASA and its partners to explore the early universe, study galaxies, and find new planets. It was launched in 2021 and placed in orbit near the Earth-Sun L2 point. The telescope's first images were released in 2022, showing its incredible capabilities.",
