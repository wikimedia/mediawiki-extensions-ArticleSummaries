It was in good condition, still had food and cargo, and the crew's belongings were untouched. The last log entry was ten days earlier. No one knows what happened to the crew. There were no signs of struggle or bad weather. People have guessed it could be a mutiny, piracy, or even a giant squid attack. The ship sailed again but was later wrecked in an insurance fraud. The mystery of the Mary Celeste has inspired many stories and movies.",
