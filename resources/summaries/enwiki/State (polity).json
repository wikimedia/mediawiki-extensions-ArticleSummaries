Most countries have one state, but some have smaller parts called provinces or regions, which also have some power.\n\nLong ago, people lived without states, but then cities grew, and governments formed. Now, there are different types of states, like the modern nation-state, which is what we usually think of when we hear the word \"country.\" Some famous thinkers, like Max Weber, say a state is the only one allowed to use force.",
