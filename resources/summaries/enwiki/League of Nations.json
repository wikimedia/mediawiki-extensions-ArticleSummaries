	"summary": "The League of Nations was the world's first international organization, created after World War I to keep peace. It started in 1920 and had 58 members at its peak. The League aimed to prevent wars, disarm countries, and solve problems through talks. It also worked on issues like human trafficking, health, and helping minorities.\n\nHowever, it struggled to stop powerful countries like Germany, Italy, and Japan from being aggressive. They left the League, which lost its power. The League failed to stop World War II, so it was replaced by the United Nations in 1946. Despite its flaws, it laid the groundwork for global cooperation and law.",
