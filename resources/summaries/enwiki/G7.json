	"summary": "##  The Group of Seven (G7)\n\nThe G7 is a group of seven wealthy countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, and the US) who meet yearly to discuss important global issues like trade, security, economics, and climate change. They don't have a permanent office, but the country hosting the meeting each year sets the agenda.  The European Union is also involved.  While the G7 doesn't have official rules, it has helped start big projects like fighting HIV/AIDS and addressing climate change.  Some people criticize the G7 for only including a few countries and not representing the whole world.",
