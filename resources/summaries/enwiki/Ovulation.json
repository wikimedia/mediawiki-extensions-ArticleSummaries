	"summary": "Ovulation is when an egg comes out of a woman's ovary, which happens at the end of the follicular phase. After ovulation, the egg waits to be fertilized by sperm. If this doesn't happen, the egg breaks down within a day. The uterine lining grows thicker to prepare for a fertilized egg. If pregnancy doesn't occur, this lining eventually sheds through the vagina during menstruation.",
