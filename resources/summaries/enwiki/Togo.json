It's one of the least developed nations, with a population of about 8 million. Togo was named \"The Slave Coast\" due to historical slave trading. In 1884, Germany established Togoland, which later came under French rule after World War I. Togo gained independence in 1960. Gnassingbé Eyadéma led a military coup in 1967 and ruled for 38 years, the longest in modern African history. His son, Faure Gnassingbé, is the current president. Togo's economy relies on agriculture, and French is the official language. Christianity is the major religion. Togo is a member of several international organizations.",
