	"summary": "The Strait of Magellan is a 350-mile-long waterway in southern Chile that connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. It's named after Ferdinand Magellan, who discovered it in 1520. Originally called the \"Strait of All Saints,\" it was renamed by Emperor Charles V to honor Magellan. The strait is hard to navigate due to its narrow passages and unpredictable weather. It's a shorter and safer route compared to going around Cape Horn, but ships still need to be guided by pilots. Before the Panama Canal was built, this was one of the main paths between the two oceans.",
