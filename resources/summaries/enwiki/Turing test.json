	"summary": "The Turing Test, created by Alan Turing in 1950, checks if a machine can act like a human in a text-based conversation. An evaluator asks questions to a human and a machine, trying to figure out which is which. If the evaluator can't tell the difference, the machine passes. It's not about getting the right answers, but about sounding human. Turing wanted to know if machines could \"think\" like humans. This test is still important in discussing artificial intelligence, but it has also been criticized, especially by philosopher John Searle, who argued it doesn't prove a machine has consciousness.",
