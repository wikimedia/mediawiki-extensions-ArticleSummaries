	"summary": "London Bridge has a long history, with several structures built since Roman times. The current bridge, made of concrete and steel, opened in 1973. It replaced older bridges, including a medieval stone one. The first bridge was a wooden one built by the Romans around AD 50. The modern bridge is an important road crossing and is maintained by a charity overseen by the City of London Corporation. It's known from the nursery rhyme \"London Bridge Is Falling Down\" and T.S. Eliot's poem \"The Waste Land.\"",
