	"summary": "Bees are flying insects related to wasps and ants. They are famous for pollinating plants and making honey, especially the honey bee. There are over 20,000 bee species worldwide, living in colonies or alone. Bees are found everywhere except Antarctica, helping to spread pollen and make honey. Some bees are tiny, while others are quite large. They eat nectar and pollen, and many animals, like birds and other insects, eat bees. People have kept bees for thousands of years to get honey and help pollinate crops.",
