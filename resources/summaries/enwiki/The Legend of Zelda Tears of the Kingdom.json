You play as Link, searching for Princess Zelda and stopping Ganondorf from destroying Hyrule. The game has a big open world, similar to its previous game, **Breath of the Wild**, but with new places like floating islands and underground areas. You can use cool devices to fight and explore, even build vehicles. Developers made it after realizing they had too many ideas for **Breath of the Wild**'s extra content. The game got great reviews and sold really well.",
