	"summary": "Ultraviolet (UV) light is a type of radiation with wavelengths shorter than visible light but longer than X-rays. It makes up about 10% of the Sun's radiation and is also made by special lights like tanning lamps. UV light has more energy than visible light, which can cause chemical reactions and make some things glow.\n\nToo much UV exposure can harm your skin and increase the risk of skin cancer. However, a small amount of UV light helps our bodies make vitamin D. Insects and some animals can see ultraviolet light, but humans cannot.",
