	"summary": "In 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court made a crucial decision in the case *Brown v. Board of Education*. This ruling stated that separating students by race in public schools is against the U.S. Constitution. It was a big win for the civil rights movement.\n\nThe case started when a Black family in Topeka, Kansas, was not allowed to enroll their daughter in the closest school due to her race. They sued the school board, and the Supreme Court agreed with them, saying that \"separate but equal\" schools were unfair. This decision helped end racial segregation in schools, although it took time for changes to happen.",
