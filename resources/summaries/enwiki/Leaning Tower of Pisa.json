	"summary": "The Leaning Tower of Pisa is a famous bell tower in Italy, known for its big lean. It started leaning while being built because the ground wasn't strong enough. By 1990, it was leaning almost 6 degrees. Workers fixed it between 1993 and 2001, reducing the lean to about 4 degrees. The tower is 183 to 186 feet tall and weighs about 16,000 tons. It has 294 to 296 steps, but fewer on one staircase.",
