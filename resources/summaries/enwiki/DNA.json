	"summary": "## DNA: The Instruction Manual for Life\n\nDeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is like a recipe book for living things. It's made of two long strands that twist into a shape called a double helix. Each strand is made of smaller parts called nucleotides, which have different types of molecules attached: sugar, phosphate, and one of four bases (A, T, C, G).\n\nThe bases pair up (A with T, C with G) to hold the strands together, creating the code for building and running an organism. This code is copied before cells divide so that new cells have the same instructions.",
