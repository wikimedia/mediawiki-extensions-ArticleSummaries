	"summary": "The Minoans were an ancient civilization on the island of Crete, known for their impressive buildings and vibrant art. They lived around 3100â€“1100 BC and had a unique culture. Their art showed nature and rituals, with lively figures. Minoan society was likely complex, but we don't know much about their rulers or government. They were great traders, exchanging goods across the Mediterranean.\n\nThe Minoans created two writing systems, but we still can't fully read them, so their language is a mystery. Archaeologists have been digging up Minoan sites for over a century, uncovering amazing palaces and learning more about this fascinating ancient culture.",
