	"summary": "Lead is a heavy metal with the symbol Pb, coming from the Latin word \"plumbum.\" It's soft, malleable, and has a low melting point. Lead is unique because it has the highest atomic number of any stable element. It's been used since ancient times, especially by the Romans, who valued it for its many useful properties. Lead is toxic, however, and can cause serious health problems by accumulating in the body. Its use has been reduced due to these dangers, but it's still important in batteries, radiation shielding, and some construction materials.",
