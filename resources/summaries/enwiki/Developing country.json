	"summary": "Developing countries are places with less advanced economies and lower living standards compared to richer nations. They often face challenges like poverty, lack of access to clean water and education, poor healthcare, and higher pollution levels. These countries might also deal with issues like high crime rates, political instability, and limited job opportunities. \n\nThe term \"developing\" is sometimes controversial, as it can create a divide between \"us and them.\" Some prefer terms like \"Global South\" instead. The World Bank is moving away from this label, focusing more on regional and income-based groupings.",
