	"summary": "Alcatraz Island, also known as \"The Rock,\" was a very secure federal prison near San Francisco, California. It was built in the early 1900s and became a federal prison in 1934. The prison was believed to be escape-proof due to its location in San Francisco Bay. It had four main cell blocks, and the cells were small and basic. Inmates worked in various jobs during the day, and the prison had its own dining hall and hospital. Alcatraz closed in 1963 and is now a popular museum and tourist attraction, managed by the National Park Service.",
