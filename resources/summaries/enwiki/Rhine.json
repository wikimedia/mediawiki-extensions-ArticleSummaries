	"summary": "The Rhine is a significant river in Europe, flowing through several countries. It starts in the Swiss Alps and borders Liechtenstein, Austria, and Germany. Further, it defines parts of the France-Germany border and flows through the German Rhineland. Eventually, it turns west and empties into the North Sea in the Netherlands. The river is about 760 miles long and drains a large area. Its name comes from the Celtic word \"RÄ“nos.\" The Rhine is crucial for trade and has many important cities along its banks. However, climate change threatens its future flow.",
