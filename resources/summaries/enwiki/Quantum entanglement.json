	"summary": "Quantum entanglement is a cool science concept where particles become connected, even when far apart. When one particle is measured, its partner instantly \"knows\" what happened, no matter the distance. This is like having a secret code that only you and your friend understand!\n\nScientists once thought this was impossible, but experiments have proven it's real. Entangled particles can be used for super-fast computers and secret messaging. It's a bit like magic, but it's all based on tiny particles acting in a special way.",
