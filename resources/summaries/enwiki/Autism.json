	"summary": "Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition that affects social communication and behavior. People with autism may struggle with social interactions, have limited interests, and follow strict routines. The severity of symptoms varies, and some individuals may not speak. Diagnosis requires these symptoms to cause significant challenges in daily life.\n\nCommon signs include difficulty understanding social cues, repetitive behaviors, and sensitivity to sensory input. Some view autism as a natural part of human diversity, advocating for acceptance rather than a cure. Others focus on genetic and environmental causes. There's no cure, but early intervention with therapies like applied behavior analysis (ABA) can help. Medication can also manage certain symptoms.",
