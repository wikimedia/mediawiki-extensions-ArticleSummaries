	"summary": "## Cougar\n\nThe cougar, also called a mountain lion or puma, is a big cat found throughout the Americas. It lives in various habitats, from forests to mountains, and is adaptable to different environments. Cougars are solitary hunters, mainly eating deer and other animals. They are usually shy around people but sometimes attack humans, though it's rare.\n\nAlthough cougars are widespread, their numbers have decreased due to hunting and habitat loss. They are considered \"Least Concern\" by conservationists, but some populations, like the eastern cougar, are close to extinction.",
