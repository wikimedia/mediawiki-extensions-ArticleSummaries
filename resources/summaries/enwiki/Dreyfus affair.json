He was sent to a harsh prison, even though another man, Major Esterhazy, was the real culprit.\n\nWriter Ã‰mile Zola helped prove Dreyfus' innocence, but it took years for the truth to come out. France became divided between people who believed Dreyfus was guilty (anti-Dreyfusards) and those who supported him (Dreyfusards). Finally, Dreyfus was set free and proved his innocence. This event showed how bad injustice and antisemitism could be.",
