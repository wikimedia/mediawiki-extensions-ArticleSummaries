	"summary": "Liberalism is a political idea that believes in individual freedom and rights. It started during the Age of Enlightenment and became popular among philosophers. Liberals support things like democracy, equal treatment under the law, and free markets. They want to get rid of old rules like royal power and hereditary privilege.\n\nJohn Locke, a philosopher, said people have natural rights to life, liberty, and property. This idea inspired big changes, like the American and French Revolutions. Over time, liberalism spread worldwide, leading to democratic governments and civil rights movements. It's still an important ideology today, with liberal parties in many countries.",
