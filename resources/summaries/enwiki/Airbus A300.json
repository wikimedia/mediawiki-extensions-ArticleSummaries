	"summary": "The Airbus A300 was the first plane made by Airbus, a big company from Europe. It was special because it was the first plane with two engines and lots of space inside. The A300 could fly far and usually had 247 seats. It was made to be different from other planes, with three people in the cockpit at first, and later just two. Even though it started slow, people liked it once they saw it worked well. It's still used today by some airlines and cargo companies.",
