	"summary": "Haredi Judaism is a conservative branch of Orthodox Judaism. Its followers, known as Haredim, believe in strictly following Jewish laws and traditions. They think their way is the only true form of Judaism. Haredim often separate themselves from modern society and other Jewish groups, like Modern Orthodox Jews.\n\nThis group started as a reaction to changes like political freedom and the Enlightenment. They live mostly in Israel, North America, and Europe, and their population is growing due to high birth rates and people converting from secular backgrounds.",
