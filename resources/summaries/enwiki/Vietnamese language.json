The language uses words with one to eight syllables, not just one syllable as some people think.\n\nVietnamese is written with a unique alphabet called chữ Quốc ngữ, which is based on the Latin script. Before this, a different system called chữ Nôm, using Chinese-style characters, was used. The Vietnamese alphabet includes special letters and marks for tones.",
