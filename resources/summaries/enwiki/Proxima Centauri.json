	"summary": "Proxima Centauri is the closest star to our solar system, located about 4.25 light-years away. It's a small, faint red dwarf star in the constellation Centaurus. Discovered in 1915, it's part of the Alpha Centauri system. Proxima Centauri has a mass about 12.5% of the Sun's and is much denser. It's a flare star, randomly getting brighter due to magnetic activity.\n\nThis star has an exoplanet, Proxima Centauri b, in its habitable zone, where water could exist. However, due to the star's nature, the planet's habitability is uncertain. There are also two other possible exoplanets, Proxima Centauri c and d.",
