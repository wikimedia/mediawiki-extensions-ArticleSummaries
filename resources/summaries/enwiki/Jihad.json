	"summary": "Jihad is an Arabic word meaning \"striving\" or \"struggling.\" In Islam, it refers to efforts to live a good life and create a strong Muslim community, as well as defending Islam. It can be an internal struggle against one's own negative traits, or an external struggle using words or, sometimes, warfare. Most Muslims believe the inner struggle is more important. The Quran mentions jihad in both peaceful and wartime contexts. In modern times, the term is often misused by extremist groups to justify violence, but many Islamic scholars emphasize its peaceful meanings.",
