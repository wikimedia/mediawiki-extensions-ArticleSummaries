	"summary": "Apollo 8, launched in 1968, was a groundbreaking NASA mission. It was the first time humans traveled beyond Earth's orbit and reached the Moon. The crew, consisting of Frank Borman, James Lovell, and William Anders, orbited the Moon ten times. They captured stunning photos of the Moon's far side and a breathtaking Earthrise.\n\nInitially planned as a test for the Lunar Module, the mission was redesigned due to delays. Instead, Apollo 8 became a daring journey to the Moon using only the Command Module. This successful mission broadcasted a memorable Christmas Eve program, reading from the Bible, and inspired the world. It paved the way for future lunar landings, fulfilling President Kennedy's vision.",
