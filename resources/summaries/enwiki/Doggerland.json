	"summary": "Doggerland was a large area of land in Northern Europe, now under the North Sea. It was exposed during the Ice Age due to lower sea levels. At its peak, around 10,000 years ago, it connected Britain, the Netherlands, Germany, and Denmark. Rising seas flooded Doggerland over time, turning it into islands before it disappeared. \n\nArchaeologists have discovered ancient tools, weapons, and animal remains, showing that people and wildlife once lived there. The area is being studied using modern techniques to learn more about this lost landscape and how it changed over time.",
