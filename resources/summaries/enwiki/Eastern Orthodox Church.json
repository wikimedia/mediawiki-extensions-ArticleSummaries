	"summary": "## Eastern Orthodox Church\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church is the second-largest Christian church, with around 230 million members. It's really old, dating back to Jesus Christ himself, and its beliefs are based on the Bible and traditions passed down through the centuries.\n\nThey have no single leader like the Pope. Instead, they're like a family of independent churches, each led by bishops, who make decisions together.  They believe in seven main sacraments, with the Eucharist being the most important. The Virgin Mary is also very important to them.\n\nMost Eastern Orthodox Christians live in Russia, Ukraine, and other Eastern European countries.",
