It's like a big puzzle where scientists make guesses, test them, and then learn what works and what doesn't. There are different types of science, like physics, biology, and psychology, each exploring different parts of our world.\n\nScience has been around for a very long time, starting with ancient civilizations like the Egyptians and Mesopotamians. Over centuries, many cultures have contributed to scientific knowledge, leading to big discoveries and inventions.
