	"summary": "The kidneys are two small, bean-shaped organs located in your back. They filter waste and extra fluid from your blood to make urine. This helps keep the right balance of water and other substances in your body. Kidneys also help control blood pressure, make red blood cells, and keep your bones strong.\n\nDiseases like chronic kidney disease can damage the kidneys and lead to kidney failure. This may require treatments like dialysis or a kidney transplant. Doctors who specialize in kidney health are called nephrologists.",
