	"summary": "Natural disasters like tropical cyclones, droughts, earthquakes, floods, landslides, and volcanoes can cause serious economic losses. They can harm people and destroy property, especially in areas where buildings are weak or people aren't prepared. The term \"natural disaster\" is being questioned because human actions, like bad building practices or climate change, can make these events worse. Developing countries often lack systems to reduce disaster risks, making them more vulnerable. Disasters happen when vulnerable communities are hit by these hazards.",
