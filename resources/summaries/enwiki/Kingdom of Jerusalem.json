	"summary": "The Kingdom of Jerusalem, or Crusader Kingdom, was a state in the Middle East after the First Crusade. It existed for about 200 years, from 1099 to 1291, with a short break in between. The kingdom was ruled by leaders from France, and many French people settled there. It had two main periods: the first ended in 1187 when it was taken over by Saladin's Ayyubid Sultanate, and the second began in 1192 when it was re-established in Acre after the Third Crusade. Old French became the main language, and it was a mix of cultures with Christians, Muslims, and Europeans living together.",
