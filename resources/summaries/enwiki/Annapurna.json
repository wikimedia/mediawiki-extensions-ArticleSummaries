In 1950, a French team led by Maurice Herzog was the first to reach the summit. The area around the mountain is protected as the Annapurna Conservation Area, popular for trekking and climbing. Despite recent improvements, it remains one of the most challenging and deadly mountains to climb, with many avalanches and unpredictable weather. As of 2022, 365 people have reached the top, while 72 have lost their lives trying.",
