	"summary": "Bed bugs are tiny, blood-sucking insects that feed at night. Their bites can cause skin rashes, itching, and sometimes fever. These bugs are found worldwide and are not linked to poor hygiene. They spread by crawling or hitchhiking on items. Getting rid of them is hard as they can survive for almost a year without food. Treatment involves managing symptoms and repeated home treatments like heating, vacuuming, and using pesticides. Bed bugs have been around for thousands of years, but their numbers increased recently due to travel, second-hand goods, and pesticide resistance.",
