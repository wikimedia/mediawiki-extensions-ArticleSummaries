	"summary": "## Archangel Michael Trampling Lucifer (Summary)\n\nGuido Reni's painting depicts Archangel Michael, a powerful angel in Christianity and Judaism. Archangels are high-ranking messengers of God. Though often thought of as the highest angels, they're actually the second-lowest rank.  Michael, known as the \"Chief of the Heavenly Host,\" is shown defeating Lucifer, symbolizing good triumphing over evil.\n\nThe Bible doesn't have a detailed angel hierarchy, but other texts and traditions give Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, and Uriel special importance.",
