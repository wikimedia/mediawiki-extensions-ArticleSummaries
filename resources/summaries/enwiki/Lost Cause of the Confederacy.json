	"summary": "The \"Lost Cause\" is a false idea that says the Confederacy in the Civil War was right and not about slavery. It started after the war and is still believed by some today. Historians prove this wrong, showing that slavery was the main reason for the war.\n\nSlaves in America suffered terrible treatment, including rape and being torn from their families. The Lost Cause ignores this, claiming slavery was good. It also says the South lost due to being outnumbered, not because they were fighting to keep slavery. This myth kept racism alive and supported laws like Jim Crow.",
