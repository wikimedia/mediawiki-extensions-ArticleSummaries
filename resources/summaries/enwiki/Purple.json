	"summary": "Purple is a color like a dark pink or light violet. It's made by mixing red and blue in different ways, depending on if it's for art, printing, or screens. Purple is special because it was once very expensive to make, so it became a color for kings and queens. Now, people often think of purple as a royal, rare, and mysterious color. It can also represent luxury and spirituality. When mixed with pink, it can be linked to love and femininity.",
