	"summary": "A nonprofit organization (NPO) is a group that works for the benefit of the public, not to make money for owners. They can be schools, hospitals, charities, or social clubs. NPOs must use any extra money to support their mission, not give it to individuals.\n\nThese organizations are accountable to many people, like donors and volunteers. Public trust is essential for NPOs, especially for those relying on donations. Being transparent and ethical helps build this trust.\n\nIn the US, there's a difference between NPOs and \"not-for-profit\" organizations. The latter don't aim for public benefit, like some sports clubs. Rules and names can vary by region.",
