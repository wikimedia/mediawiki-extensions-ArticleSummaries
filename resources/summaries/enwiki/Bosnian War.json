	"summary": "The Bosnian War was a conflict in the former Yugoslavia. It started when Bosnia and Herzegovina, with its mix of Muslims (Bosniaks), Serbs, and Croats, voted for independence. The Bosnian Serbs, backed by Serbia, wanted their own territory and fought against the Bosniak-led government and Croatian forces.\n\nThe war had lots of violence, including attacks on cities and ethnic cleansing. The worst event was the Srebrenica massacre, where Serb forces killed over 8,000 Bosniak men. It's considered a genocide. The war ended after international peace talks, with Bosnia divided into two parts: the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republika Srpska. Many people were charged with war crimes.",
