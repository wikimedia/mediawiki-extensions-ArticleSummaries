	"summary": "## Cell Membrane: Your Cell's Gatekeeper\n\nThe cell membrane is like a protective wall around your cells. It's made of fatty molecules (lipids) arranged in two layers, with proteins mixed in. This structure controls what enters and leaves the cell, acting like a selective gatekeeper. It also helps cells stick together, send signals, and maintain their shape. Some special molecules, like glycolipids, on the outside help cells interact with their environment.",
