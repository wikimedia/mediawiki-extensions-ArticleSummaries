	"summary": "Arwen is a half-elf character in J.R.R. Tolkien's *The Lord of the Rings*. She is the daughter of Elrond and Celebrian, making her related to the powerful elf, Galadriel. Arwen marries Aragorn, a human king. In the book, she doesn't have a significant role in the action, but in Peter Jackson's movie, she becomes a hero, saving Frodo from the Black Riders. This change gives her a more active and memorable part in the film.",
