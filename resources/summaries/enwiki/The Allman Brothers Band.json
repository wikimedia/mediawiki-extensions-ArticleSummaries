	"summary": "The Allman Brothers Band was an American rock band formed in 1969 in Jacksonville, Florida. They mixed blues, jazz, and country music and were known for their live improvisations. Their first albums didn't sell well, but their live album \"At Fillmore East\" (1971) was a big success. Tragically, band leader Duane Allman died in a motorcycle accident in 1971, and bassist Berry Oakley died a year later. The band continued, releasing more albums, but broke up in 1976. They reunited in 1989 and played together until 2014. Several original members have since passed away. The band was very popular and is now in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.",
