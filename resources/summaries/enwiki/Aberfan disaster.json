	"summary": "The Aberfan disaster happened in Wales on October 21, 1966, when a huge pile of mining waste (called a spoil tip) collapsed and slid into the village below. This was caused by heavy rain and the tip being built over a spring. It destroyed a school and houses, killing 116 children and 28 adults. The National Coal Board, who managed the mine, was blamed for not following safety rules. A big fundraising effort helped the village recover, and the remaining tips were eventually removed. The tragedy had a lasting impact on the community's health and well-being.",
