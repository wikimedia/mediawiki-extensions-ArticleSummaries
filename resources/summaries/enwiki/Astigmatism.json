	"summary": "Astigmatism is a common eye condition that causes blurry or distorted vision at any distance. It happens when the shape of your eye is not completely round, like a soccer ball, but more like a rugby ball. This irregular shape makes it hard for your eye to focus light properly. People with astigmatism might also experience eye strain, headaches, and difficulty driving at night.\n\nYou can get astigmatism at birth or develop it later. It can be treated with glasses, contact lenses, or surgery. Glasses are the easiest fix, but contact lenses can give you a wider field of vision. Surgery is also an option to permanently change the shape of your eye. Many adults in Europe and Asia have astigmatism.",
