	"summary": "The Dead Sea is a unique salt lake in the Middle East. It is very salty, about 9.6 times saltier than the ocean, making it easy to float in. This extreme salinity prevents plants and animals from living in it, which is how it got its name. It is the lowest point on Earth, 430.5 meters below sea level. People have visited this lake for thousands of years, and it has been used for health benefits and to make useful products. Unfortunately, the Dead Sea is shrinking, and people are trying to find ways to save it.",
