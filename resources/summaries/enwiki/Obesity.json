	"summary": "Obesity is when someone has too much body fat, which can cause health problems. It's measured using BMI, which compares height and weight. A BMI over 30 means obesity, and between 25 and 30 is overweight. Obesity can lead to serious issues like heart disease, diabetes, and joint pain.\n\nMany things cause obesity, like eating unhealthy food, not exercising, and even some medicines. Losing weight is hard, and keeping it off is even harder. Doctors recommend eating better and exercising, but sometimes medicine or surgery is needed. Obesity is a big problem worldwide, affecting over 1 billion people.",
