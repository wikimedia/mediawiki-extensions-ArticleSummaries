	"summary": "Sushi is a popular Japanese dish made with vinegared rice and various toppings like vegetables, meat, or seafood. The most common type is nigiri-zushi, invented around 1824, where seafood is placed on hand-pressed rice. Sushi can be made with different types of rice and is often served with pickled ginger, wasabi, and soy sauce. It's important not to confuse sushi with sashimi, which is just raw fish without rice.",
