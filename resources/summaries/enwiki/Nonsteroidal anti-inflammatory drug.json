	"summary": "Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen reduce pain, inflammation, and fever. They work by blocking enzymes that make substances causing inflammation. There are two types: non-selective and COX-2 selective. Non-selective NSAIDs can cause stomach ulcers, while COX-2 selective ones may increase heart attack risk. Common NSAIDs are aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen, available without a prescription. Paracetamol is not an NSAID because it has little anti-inflammatory effect.",
