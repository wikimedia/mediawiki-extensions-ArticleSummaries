	"summary": "A thermobaric weapon, also known as an aerosol bomb or vacuum bomb, is a powerful explosive that spreads a cloud of gas, liquid, or powder. Unlike regular bombs, it uses a single type of fuel. These weapons can be launched from planes or used with hand-held launchers. When it explodes, the fuel mixes with the air, creating a huge fireball and powerful blast wave, making it very destructive.",
