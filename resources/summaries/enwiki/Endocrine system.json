	"summary": "The endocrine system is like your body's post office, delivering important messages (hormones) to keep everything running smoothly. It's made up of glands that release these hormones into your blood. These hormones travel far and wide to tell your organs what to do. For example, the thyroid gland makes thyroxine, which helps control your energy levels.\n\nThe brain's hypothalamus is the boss of this system, coordinating messages between the endocrine system and your nervous system. This system also includes glands like the pituitary, adrenal glands, and the ovaries or testicles, depending on your gender.",
