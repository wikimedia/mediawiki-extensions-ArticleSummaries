	"summary": "An acre is a unit of land area used in the British imperial and U.S. customary systems. It's about 40% of a hectare or roughly 4,047 square meters. Historically, it was the amount of land one man and eight oxen could plow in a day. Acres are commonly used to measure land, especially in the United States where it's still a legal measure. While some countries have stopped using acres officially, it's still widely recognized and used in many Commonwealth nations.",
