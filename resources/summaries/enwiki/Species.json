	"summary": "A species is a group of living things that can make babies together and have similar features. Scientists use a two-part name to identify each species, like \"Boa constrictor\" for a type of snake. There are lots of ways to tell species apart, like looking at their DNA or how they behave. Some species change over time and can even merge with others, which makes defining them a bit tricky. But even with these challenges, the concept of species helps scientists study and protect life on Earth.",
