	"summary": "Hijab is a term that describes head coverings worn by many Muslim women. It is a way to show their faith and modesty. The hijab usually covers the hair, neck, and ears, but leaves the face uncovered. Many Muslim women choose to wear it, and it has become more popular worldwide since the 1970s.\n\nThe word 'hijab' originally meant a curtain or partition. In the Quran, it refers to a curtain in Muhammad's house. Some people believe this means the hijab is only for Muhammad's wives, while others say it symbolizes modesty for all women. There are different rules about how much of the body should be covered, and these vary by country.",
