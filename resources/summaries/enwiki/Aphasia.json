	"summary": "Aphasia is a language disorder caused by damage to specific brain regions, often due to stroke or head trauma. It affects a person's ability to understand or produce language, including speaking, reading, and writing. People with aphasia might struggle to find the right words or even lose the ability to communicate verbally. However, their intelligence remains intact. This condition can also impact sign language and expressive language, but it often spares common phrases. Anomia, difficulty finding words, is a common symptom. Aphasia is not related to speech mechanics but rather to language processing in the brain.",
