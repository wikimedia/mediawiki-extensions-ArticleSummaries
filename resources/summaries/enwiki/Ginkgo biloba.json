	"summary": "Ginkgo biloba, often called ginkgo or maidenhair tree, is a unique tree native to East Asia. It's a living fossil, meaning it has existed for millions of years with little change. This gymnosperm tree is the only surviving species of its kind, with fossils dating back to the Jurassic period. People have cultivated it for a long time and often plant it today. Ginkgo leaf extract is popular as a supplement, but there's not enough scientific proof to support its health benefits.",
