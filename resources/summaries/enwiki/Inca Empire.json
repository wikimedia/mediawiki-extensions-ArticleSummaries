	"summary": "The Inca Empire, also called Tawantinsuyu, was a huge empire in South America, centered in modern-day Peru. It began in the 13th century and lasted until the Spanish conquest in the 16th century. The Incas ruled over a large area, including parts of Ecuador, Bolivia, Argentina, Chile, and Colombia. Their capital was Cusco, and their language was Quechua.\n\nThe Incas were known for their impressive architecture, road system, and unique ways of keeping records and communicating. They had no money or markets; instead, they traded goods and services. The Inca rulers were like kings, and people worked for them in return for land and resources. The Incas also had special religious beliefs, worshipping the sun god Inti.",
