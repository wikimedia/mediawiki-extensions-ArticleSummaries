	"summary": "The English alphabet has 26 letters, using the Latin script. It's named after the first two letters of the Greek alphabet, 'alpha' and 'beta'. Old English was first written using this alphabet in the 7th century. Over time, some letters were added or removed, and by the 16th century, the current set was mostly set. There are 5 vowels and 19 consonants, with Y and W being versatile. English often uses digraphs (two letters representing one sound) like 'ch' and 'th'. It's unique among European languages as it rarely uses diacritics (marks to show pronunciation).",
