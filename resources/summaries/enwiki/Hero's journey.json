	"summary": "In stories, a hero often goes on an exciting adventure, faces challenges, and wins a big victory. After this journey, the hero returns home changed. This pattern is called the \"hero's journey\" or \"monomyth.\" Joseph Campbell, inspired by psychologists like Carl Jung, made this idea popular. He said heroes leave the normal world, face magical tests, and come back with special powers to help others. Some experts don't agree with this theory, but many still find it useful to understand stories.",
