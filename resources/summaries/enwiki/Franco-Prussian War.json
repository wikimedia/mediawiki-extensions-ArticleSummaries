	"summary": "The Franco-Prussian War was a conflict between France and the North German Confederation, led by Prussia. It started because France wanted to be powerful in Europe after Prussia's win over Austria in 1866. Some historians think Prussia's leader, Otto von Bismarck, wanted this war to unite German states.\n\nThe German army was bigger, better trained, and used modern tech like trains and artillery. They won many battles, captured the French emperor, and surrounded Paris. France had to pay a huge fine and give up some land.\n\nThis war led to the creation of the German Empire and changed Europe's power balance. It also ended imperial rule in France and started a new republican government.",
