	"summary": "Botflies are a type of fly that act as parasites on mammals. Their scientific name is Oestridae. The larvae of these flies live inside the host animal's body, either in their flesh or gut. One species, called *Dermatobia hominis*, often targets humans. This makes it unique, as not all botfly species infect people. These parasites can cause a condition called myiasis, which means a fly larva lives inside a mammal.",
