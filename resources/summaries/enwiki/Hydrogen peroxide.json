	"summary": "Hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) is a pale blue liquid used as a cleaner and antiseptic. It's a powerful oxidizer, found in nature and the human body. When pure, it's explosive, so it's usually diluted for safe use. In higher concentrations, it fuels rockets! It breaks down into water and oxygen, slowly with light or quickly with other compounds. Proper storage prevents decomposition.",
