	"summary": "Nymphs were nature spirits in ancient Greek stories. They were like minor goddesses but were tied to specific places like trees or mountains. These female beings had special powers, like healing and shape-shifting. Some famous types of nymphs include tree nymphs (Meliae and Dryads), spring nymphs (Naiads), and sea nymphs (Nereids).\n\nNymphs were often shown as beautiful young women and were linked to love stories. They could be kind or mischievous, sometimes helping heroes but also causing trouble in their relationships. Over time, people started connecting nymphs with fairies.",
