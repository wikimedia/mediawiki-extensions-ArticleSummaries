PCs come with a metal case holding the computer parts, a screen, and a keyboard.\n\nIn the past, people had to write their own programs to use computers. Now, most people use software made by others, like Microsoft Windows or Apple's macOS.  \"PC\" now usually means a computer with a Windows operating system and Intel hardware. Other types of PCs use different systems, like macOS or Linux.",
