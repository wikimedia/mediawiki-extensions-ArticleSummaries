Michael Collins piloted the command module, Columbia, while the other two were on the Moon.\n\nThe mission began on July 16th with a Saturn V rocket launch from Florida. After a three-day journey, they orbited the Moon, and Armstrong and Aldrin landed their lunar module, Eagle, in the Sea of Tranquility. They returned safely to Earth on July 24th, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThis achievement marked the end of the Space Race, fulfilling President Kennedy's goal of landing a man on the Moon.",
