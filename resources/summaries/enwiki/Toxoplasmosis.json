	"summary": "Toxoplasmosis is a disease caused by a tiny creature called Toxoplasma gondii. It can make you sick if you eat undercooked food with the creature in it, touch infected cat poop, or get it from your mom if she's infected during pregnancy. Symptoms can be mild, like flu, or serious, like seizures, depending on your health. To avoid it, cook food well, don't clean cat litter if you're pregnant, and wash your hands often. Many people have it but don't get sick. It's common worldwide, with up to half of people infected.",
