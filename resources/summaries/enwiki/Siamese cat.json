	"summary": "Siamese cats are one of the first recognized Asian cat breeds, originally from Thailand. They have a unique colorpoint coat, blue almond-shaped eyes, and a triangular head. The modern Siamese looks different from the original ones, which had rounder heads and bodies. Siamese and Thai cats (the original type) are bred separately but are both purebred and registered. Siamese cats helped create other breeds like the Oriental Shorthair, Colourpoint Shorthair, and the long-haired Balinese cat. They also contributed to hairless breeds like the Sphynx.",
