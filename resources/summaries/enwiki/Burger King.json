	"summary": "Burger King is an American fast-food restaurant chain that started in 1953 as Insta-Burger King. It was renamed and expanded, changing owners several times. In 2010, a Brazilian company, 3G Capital, bought a majority stake. They restructured the company and merged it with Tim Hortons under a new parent company, Restaurant Brands International.\n\nThe menu has grown from burgers, fries, and shakes to include more items like the iconic \"Whopper.\" Burger King has many global franchises, with almost half of its restaurants in the U.S. They've had some legal issues with franchisees, including a name change in Australia due to a trademark dispute.",
