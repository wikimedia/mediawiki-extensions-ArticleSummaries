	"summary": "The black mamba is a dangerous snake found in Africa. It's one of the longest venomous snakes, growing up to 15 feet! Despite its name, its skin is gray to brown, but its mouth is black. These snakes live in various places, from open savannas to forests. They hunt birds and small animals during the day. When threatened, they open their black mouths and spread their necks, sometimes hissing. Their bite is very poisonous and can kill quickly. However, they only attack humans if scared or cornered.",
