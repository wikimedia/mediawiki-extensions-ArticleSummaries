	"summary": "Isis was a very important goddess in ancient Egypt, first mentioned around 2686 BCE. She brought her dead husband, Osiris, back to life and protected their son, Horus. People believed she could help the dead get into the afterlife. Over time, she became even more powerful, taking on traits from other goddesses like Hathor. By the first millennium BCE, Isis and Osiris were the most popular Egyptian gods. Her worship spread to Greece, Rome, and even Nubia. People believed she had great magical powers and could control nature and fate. However, her worship declined with the rise of Christianity. Today, she still appears in Western culture, especially in modern paganism.",
