	"summary": "The Lord's Prayer, also called \"Our Father,\" is a key prayer in Christianity that Jesus taught his followers. There are two versions in the Bible: one in Matthew's gospel and a shorter one in Luke's gospel. People think Jesus taught the longer version first in Galilee and the shorter one later in Judea. An ancient book called Didache has a version similar to Matthew's. This prayer is a simple and powerful way for Christians to talk to God.",
