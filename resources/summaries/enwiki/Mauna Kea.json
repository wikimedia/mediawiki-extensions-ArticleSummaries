	"summary": "Mauna Kea is a very tall, dormant volcano in Hawaii. It's the highest point in Hawaii, even taller than its neighbor, Mauna Loa. Its peak is over 13,000 feet above sea level, and if measured from under the ocean, it's even more impressive! This makes it one of the world's most prominent mountains.\n\nThe mountain is about a million years old and has a steep, rough appearance. It was once active but is now dormant, last erupting thousands of years ago. In Hawaiian culture, the peak is sacred, and only special people were allowed to visit. Today, it's known for its amazing views and is a popular place for astronomers to study the sky.",
