	"summary": "Leukemia is a type of blood cancer that starts in the bone marrow, making lots of abnormal blood cells. These cells can't do their normal jobs, causing symptoms like bleeding, tiredness, and infections. There are four main types, and it's more common in adults, but it's the most frequent childhood cancer. The cause is unknown, but smoking and radiation might increase the risk. Treatment includes chemotherapy and sometimes radiation or a bone marrow transplant. Survival rates are better in developed countries, especially for children.",
