It's mostly used as a recreational drug for its euphoric effects but is also used medically in some countries for pain relief. Heroin is usually injected, but it can also be snorted, smoked, or inhaled. It causes side effects like slow breathing, drowsiness, and addiction. Long-term use can lead to serious health problems. Treatment for addiction includes therapy and medications.\n\nFirst made in 1874, heroin is controlled internationally due to its harmful effects. It's often mixed with other substances on the black market. As of 2015, around 17 million people used opiates, with heroin being the most common, leading to over 122,000 deaths.",
