	"summary": "\"Eraserhead\" is a black-and-white 1977 movie by David Lynch. It's about a dad who has to take care of his weird-looking baby in a sad, industrial place. The film took a long time to make because of money problems, but it's now considered a cool, \"cult\" movie. People like its strange pictures and how it sounds. It's so important that the Library of Congress saved it for future generations.",
