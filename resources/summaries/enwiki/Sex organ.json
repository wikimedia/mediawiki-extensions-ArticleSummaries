	"summary": "Sex organs, also called reproductive organs, help living things reproduce. They make and move tiny cells called gametes, which join together to create new life.\n\nAnimals, including people, have different male and female sex organs. Male ones produce sperm, and female ones produce eggs. In plants, male parts make pollen, and female parts make ovules. Flowers and cones aren't sex organs themselves but contain them.",
