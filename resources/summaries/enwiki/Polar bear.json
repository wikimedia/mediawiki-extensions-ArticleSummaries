	"summary": "Polar bears are huge, white bears living near the North Pole. They are the largest land carnivores, with males weighing up to 800 kg. These bears have sharp teeth and are excellent swimmers, hunting seals in the icy water. They also eat walruses and whales.\n\nPolar bears are in danger because of climate change, which melts their icy homes. This makes it harder for them to find food and can lead to starvation. People also hunt them for their fur and meat. Currently, there are around 22,000 to 31,000 polar bears left in the wild.",
