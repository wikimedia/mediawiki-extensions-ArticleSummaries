They live in shallow ocean waters and attach themselves to surfaces, feeding on floating food. There are over 2,000 species. Some have hard shells, while others are parasites. Barnacles have been around for over 300 million years. They have cultural significance in folklore and are also eaten in some places. They can be a problem on ships, slowing them down.",
