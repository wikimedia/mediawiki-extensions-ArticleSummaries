	"summary": "Strep throat is a sore throat caused by bacteria called *Streptococcus pyogenes*. It's a common infection, especially in kids, and can make your throat feel really painful and swollen. You might also get a fever, headache, and even a rash. It spreads when someone with strep throat talks, coughs, or sneezes, sending tiny drops of fluid into the air.\n\nTo avoid getting sick, wash your hands often, don't share utensils, and stay away from people who are infected. If you do get strep throat, doctors can give you antibiotics to help you feel better and stop the spread of the bacteria.",
