	"summary": "St. Elmo's fire is a cool weather event where electricity in the air makes a bright blue or purple glow around tall things like ship masts or airplane wings. It happens when there's a strong electric field, like during a thunderstorm. This phenomenon is named after St. Elmo, the patron saint of sailors, because it often warned them of lightning. It can look like magic fire and sounds like hissing or buzzing.",
