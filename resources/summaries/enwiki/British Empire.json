	"summary": "The British Empire was the largest in history, ruling over many countries and people. It started in the 16th century when England set up trading posts. At its peak, it had power over 412 million people and 24% of the world's land. This was called \"the empire on which the sun never sets.\" After losing some colonies, Britain focused on Asia and Africa. Its power declined after World War I and II, and most colonies became independent. Today, some places still have British ties, like the Commonwealth of Nations.",
