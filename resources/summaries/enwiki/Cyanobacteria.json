	"summary": "Cyanobacteria are tiny, ancient organisms that live in water and soil. They are special because they can make their own food using sunlight, a process called photosynthesis. This makes them important for life on Earth. Billions of years ago, they released oxygen into the atmosphere, changing the planet's environment. This event allowed other living things to evolve.\n\nThese bacteria are like tiny factories, using sunlight to turn water and carbon dioxide into food. They also produce oxygen as a byproduct. Some cyanobacteria are used in science and technology for various purposes, but certain types can also make harmful toxins.",
