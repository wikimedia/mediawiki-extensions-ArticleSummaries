	"summary": "The Habsburg monarchy was a powerful group of territories ruled by the Habsburg family. It began in 1273 when Rudolf I became King of Germany and gained control of Austria. Over time, they acquired more lands through marriage and inheritance, including Spain, the Netherlands, and parts of Italy and Hungary.\n\nThe monarchy was not a single country but a collection of different regions with their own laws and rulers, all under the Habsburgs. It was divided into three main groups: the Archduchy of Austria, Inner Austria, and Further Austria. The Habsburgs ruled as Holy Roman Emperors for many years.\n\nIn the 19th century, it became the Austrian Empire and later split into Austria and Hungary. It eventually ended after World War I.",
