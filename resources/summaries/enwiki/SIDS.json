	"summary": "SIDS is when a baby under one year old dies suddenly and unexpectedly, even after thorough investigations. It often happens during sleep, with no signs of struggle. The exact cause is unknown, but it might be due to a mix of factors like sleeping position, overheating, and tobacco smoke. Putting babies on their backs to sleep can help prevent SIDS. Other measures include using a firm mattress, keeping the room cool, and avoiding smoke. SIDS is a leading cause of infant death in Western countries, but campaigns promoting safe sleep habits have reduced its rates.",
