	"summary": "Fungi is a group of eukaryotic organisms, including yeasts, molds, and mushrooms. They are distinct from plants and bacteria due to their cell walls containing chitin. Fungi are heterotrophs, obtaining food by absorbing molecules and secreting digestive enzymes. They are found worldwide, often hidden in soil or on dead matter.\n\nFungi play crucial roles in ecosystems as decomposers and in nutrient cycling. They have various uses, from food and fermentation to medicine and pest control. However, some species can cause diseases in plants and animals. The fungus kingdom is diverse, with an estimated 2.2 to 3.8 million species, but only a fraction have been described. Modern taxonomy uses DNA analysis to classify fungi, revealing new relationships between species.",
