	"summary": "Sciatica is leg pain caused by a pinched nerve in the lower back. It can feel like a sharp, shooting pain and usually affects only one side. This condition may start suddenly, especially after lifting heavy objects. Besides pain, you might feel weakness or numbness in the leg and foot.\n\nThe most common cause is a slipped disc pressing on a nerve. Other causes include spinal issues and pregnancy. A simple test to check for sciatica is raising your leg while lying down; if it causes pain below the knee, it's likely sciatica.\n\nTreatment includes painkillers, staying active, and time, as most people recover within six weeks. Severe or long-lasting cases might need surgery.",
