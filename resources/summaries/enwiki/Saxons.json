	"summary": "The Saxons were a Germanic tribe living in northern Germany. They became a significant group in the 8th century, led by Widukind, who clashed with the Frankish emperor Charlemagne. Charlemagne eventually conquered them, turning Saxony into a duchy within the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nBefore this, Saxons were known as coastal raiders during the Roman era. They came from areas north of the Rhine, including what is now Saxony. Over time, their language, Low German, became important for trade but later declined as Dutch and German gained prominence. Today, Saxony's name remains in German regions like Lower Saxony.",
