	"summary": "Tatars are Turkic ethnic groups found across Eastern Europe and Asia. The name originally referred to a steppe tribe that became part of the Mongol Empire. Over time, it expanded to include various groups from Northern and Central Asia. Today, most Tatars live in Russia, especially in Tatarstan, where they make up over half the population. They have their own language and culture. Genetic studies show different Tatar groups have distinct origins but may share some ancestry from the Golden Horde era. Many Russian noble families also have Tatar roots.",
