	"summary": "Parasites are organisms that live on or inside another creature, called the host, causing harm. They are tiny compared to their hosts and don't usually kill them. Some examples are tapeworms and fleas. Parasites can live inside (endoparasites) or outside (ectoparasites) the host's body.\n\nPeople have known about parasites for a long time, and they are often shown in movies and books, like in *Dracula* and *Alien*. In nature, parasitism can take many forms, from stealing food to changing how the host behaves.",
