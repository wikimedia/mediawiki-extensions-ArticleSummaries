	"summary": "Four is a whole number that comes after three and before five. It is a special number because it is a square (2 x 2), and it's also the smallest number that is both a semiprime (the product of two prime numbers) and a composite number (a number with factors other than one and itself). In some East Asian cultures, people consider four to be an unlucky number.",
