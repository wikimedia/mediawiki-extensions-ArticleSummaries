	"summary": "Voltage, or potential difference, is like the pressure that pushes electrical energy from one point to another. It's measured in volts (V) and can be created by storing energy (like in a capacitor) or through processes like electromagnetic induction. This difference in electric potential can power devices or cause energy loss. You can measure voltage using a voltmeter, comparing it to a reference point, like the ground. It's a key concept in understanding how electricity works in various systems.",
