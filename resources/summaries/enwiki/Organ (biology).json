	"summary": "In a living organism, an organ is a group of tissues working together to perform a specific task. It's like a team with a common goal! Organs are made up of different types of cells and tissues, each with its own job. For instance, the intestinal wall has both epithelial and muscle tissues. Organs team up to form organ systems, which are even bigger teams for more complex functions. In humans, there are 79 identified organs, but this number can vary depending on how we define an organ.",
