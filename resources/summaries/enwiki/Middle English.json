	"summary": "Middle English was spoken from around 1150 to 1500, after the Norman Conquest. It had big changes in words, grammar, sounds, and spelling compared to Old English. At first, it had lots of local variations, but by the end of the period, a standard based on London's dialect was set, helping to create Modern English. This time also saw the start of printing in England, which helped make the language more consistent. Middle English got many new words from French and simplified old grammar rules. Early writers like John Wycliffe and Geoffrey Chaucer helped shape this new literary style.",
