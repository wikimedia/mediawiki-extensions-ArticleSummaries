	"summary": "Necrophilia is a term for a sexual attraction to corpses. It is considered a type of unusual sexual behavior called a paraphilia. This means it is not a typical or healthy sexual preference. The World Health Organization and American Psychiatric Association both recognize necrophilia as a mental health concern. The condition is rare, but it is important to seek professional help if someone experiences these feelings, as it can be disturbing and potentially harmful.",
