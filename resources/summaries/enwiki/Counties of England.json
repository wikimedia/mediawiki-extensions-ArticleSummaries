	"summary": "England is divided into different types of counties, which have been used since ancient times. There are 48 ceremonial counties, 84 local government counties, and 39 historic counties. These counties were first used for justice and later for other things like elections and military organization.\n\nIn 1889, elected county councils took over administration. Changes happened in 1965 and 1974, creating a two-tier system with county and district councils. Some counties are now governed as single units, while others have multiple districts.\n\nCounties are also used for culture, tourism, and sports. Until 1996, they were used for mail delivery, but now postcodes are used instead.",
