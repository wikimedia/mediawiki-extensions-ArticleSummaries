	"summary": "VHS, short for Video Home System, was a popular way to record and watch videos at home. It started in 1976 and used tape cassettes with magnetic tape inside. VHS became the top choice for home video, beating other formats like Betamax. These tapes could hold up to 2 hours of video, and people loved renting movies on VHS. Later, better tape formats and DVDs came along, but VHS was still used until the 2000s when digital recorders took over.",
