	"summary": "Hurricane Katrina was a super-strong storm in 2005 that caused a lot of damage and sad stories, especially in New Orleans. It started as a tropical storm, got stronger in the Gulf of Mexico, and hit land as a powerful Category 3 hurricane. The big problem was that the city's levees, built to keep water out, failed. This led to massive flooding, leaving many people without homes or basic needs. Over 1,300 people lost their lives. The disaster made people mad at how the government handled things, leading to big changes in emergency response. The name \"Katrina\" was retired because of the terrible impact.",
