	"summary": "Tomatoes are the edible berries of the plant Solanum lycopersicum, part of the nightshade family. They originated in South America and were domesticated by the Aztecs. Spanish explorers brought them to Europe in the 16th century. Tomato plants are annual vines, with self-fertilizing flowers. Modern tomatoes are mostly red and lack the sweetness of older varieties. There are thousands of different types, but they're often troubled by pests and diseases. Tomatoes have a rich, savory taste and are used in many cuisines worldwide, like pizzas, sauces, soups, and cocktails. Several towns even have annual tomato festivals.",
