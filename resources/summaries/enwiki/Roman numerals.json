	"summary": "Roman numerals are an old number system from Rome. They use letters like 'I', 'V', and 'X' to represent numbers. Though replaced by Arabic numbers around the 14th century, Roman numerals are still used in some places like clock faces, building inscriptions, and movie copyright dates. For example, 4 is often written as 'IV', and 1912 as 'MCMXII'. Today, 'MM' stands for 2000, so 2024 is 'MMXXIV'.",
