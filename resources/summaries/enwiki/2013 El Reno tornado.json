	"summary": "The 2013 El Reno tornado was a huge, powerful, and unusual tornado in Oklahoma. It was the widest tornado ever recorded, reaching 2.6 miles across. With winds over 300 mph, it was one of the strongest on record. Four storm chasers died, the first deaths in storm chasing history. The tornado killed eight people and injured 151. It was so dangerous and unique that it's now one of the most studied tornadoes ever. People in Oklahoma City tried to outrun it in their cars, which could have led to many more deaths if the tornado had hit the city directly.",
