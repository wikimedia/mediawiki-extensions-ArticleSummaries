	"summary": "Prometheus is a Titan and a god of fire in Greek mythology. He is known for giving fire, technology, and knowledge to humanity, which earned him the title of a champion of mankind. Prometheus was punished by Zeus for stealing fire from the Olympians and was condemned to eternal torment. He was bound to a rock, and an eagle ate his liver every day, only for it to grow back overnight. Prometheus represents human striving and the potential consequences of overreaching in the quest for knowledge. His story has inspired many artists and writers, including Mary Shelley, who subtitled her novel *Frankenstein* as \"The Modern Prometheus.\"",
