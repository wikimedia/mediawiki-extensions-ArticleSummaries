	"summary": "The scrotum is a pouch of skin at the base of a male's penis. It holds important parts of the male reproductive system, like the testicles. The scrotum helps keep these parts at the right temperature. When it's cold, the scrotum gets tighter to protect these organs. Think of it like a female's labia majora, but for males.",
