	"summary": "The Milky Way is our galaxy, a huge collection of stars, gas, and dust. It looks like a faint, glowing band in the night sky. Scientists estimate it has 100-400 billion stars and is shaped like a spiral, with a central bulge. Our Sun is located on one of its spiral arms. The Milky Way is part of a larger group of galaxies called the Local Group. Recent discoveries reveal it might be much bigger than we thought, with a dark matter area extending very far.",
