	"summary": "The nervous system is like the body's control center, helping animals react to their surroundings. It's made up of nervous tissue, mostly neurons, which send signals quickly. These signals help us move, feel, and think.\n\nThe system has two main parts: the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system) and nerves that reach the body (peripheral nervous system). Nerves can be motor (sending signals from the brain) or sensory (carrying info to the brain).\n\nDifferent animals have different nervous system complexities, from simple nerve nets to the elephant's 300 billion cells.",
