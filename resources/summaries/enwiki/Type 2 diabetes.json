	"summary": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a common health issue where your body struggles to use insulin properly, leading to high blood sugar. It often happens because of obesity and not enough exercise. Symptoms include feeling thirsty, peeing a lot, being tired, and losing weight without trying. If not managed, it can cause serious problems like heart disease, eye issues, and slow-healing wounds.\n\nYou can prevent T2D by maintaining a healthy weight, eating well, and staying active. Treatment includes exercise, healthy eating, and sometimes medicine or insulin injections. It's a long-term condition, but with the right care, people can live healthy lives.",
