	"summary": "Vitamin D helps our bodies absorb calcium, magnesium, and phosphate, which are essential for strong bones and overall health. Our skin makes vitamin D when exposed to sunlight, but we can also get it from some foods like fatty fish, fortified milk, and mushrooms. \n\nOur bodies need to process vitamin D to make it active. It helps regulate calcium levels and keeps our bones healthy. Vitamin D supplements are often used to prevent bone-weakening diseases like rickets and osteomalacia. However, too much vitamin D can be harmful, so it's important to get just the right amount.",
