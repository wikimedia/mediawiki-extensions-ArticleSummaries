	"summary": "A brothel is a place where people pay for sexual services from prostitutes. The term has been used since the 16th century, as seen in Joachim Beuckelaer's painting \"Brothel\" (1562). Modern brothels, like the famous Pascha in Cologne, often face legal and cultural challenges. During the 2006 World Cup, Pascha removed flags of certain countries due to protests. Brothels may operate under different names to avoid legal issues. While considered safer than street prostitution, the industry remains controversial.",
