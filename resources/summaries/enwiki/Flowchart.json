	"summary": "## Lamp Troubleshooting Flowchart Simplified\n\nThis flowchart helps you fix a broken lamp. It shows you steps as boxes, connected by arrows to show the order. First, check if the lamp is plugged in. If not, plug it in. Next, check the bulb. Is it burned out? If so, replace it. If the bulb is fine, check the switch and try flipping it. If the lamp still doesn't work, there might be a bigger problem, and you might need help from an adult or electrician.",
