	"summary": "The conflict between Israel and Hamas-led Palestinian groups began in October 2023, with a surprise attack by Hamas. This led to a deadly war, with over 40,000 Palestinian deaths and massive destruction in Gaza. Israel launched a destructive bombing campaign and invaded Gaza, resulting in the displacement of nearly all 2.3 million Palestinians there. The war has had global repercussions, with large pro-Palestinian protests and international accusations of genocide against Israel. As of February 2024, the war continues, with Israel receiving military aid from the US and facing accusations of war crimes.",
