	"summary": "Númenor, also known as Westernesse, is a fictional island in J.R.R. Tolkien's stories. It was a powerful kingdom of men west of Middle-earth. Over time, many Númenóreans stopped worshipping the god Eru Ilúvatar and rebelled against the Valar. They attacked Valinor seeking immortality, which led to Númenor's destruction and the death of most of its people. Tolkien based Númenor on the legend of Atlantis. Its story reflects biblical tales of sin and punishment. Scholars compare Númenor to ancient civilizations like Egypt and Mesopotamia.",
