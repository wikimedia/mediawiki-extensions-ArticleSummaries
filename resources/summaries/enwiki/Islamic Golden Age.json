	"summary": "The Islamic Golden Age was a time of great progress and learning in the Muslim world, lasting from the 8th to the 13th century (or possibly later). It started when the Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid founded the House of Wisdom in Baghdad, attracting scholars to translate important books into Arabic. This era saw huge advancements in science, economics, and culture. It ended with the Mongol invasions, but some experts believe it continued until the rise of powerful Islamic empires in the 15th and 16th centuries.",
