A reboot in 2015 was a flop. Marvel Studios recently got the rights back and is making a new movie, \"Fantastic Four: First Steps,\" set for 2025. The old movies are now called \"Fantastic Adventures\" on Disney+. The team consists of Reed Richards, Susan Storm, Ben Grimm, and Johnny Storm, who gain superpowers and learn to use them.",
