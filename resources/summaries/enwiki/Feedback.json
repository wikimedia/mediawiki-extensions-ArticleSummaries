	"summary": "A feedback loop is when a system's output (result) becomes its input again. This creates a cycle where the system constantly adjusts based on its own outputs. Think of it like a thermostat: when the room gets too hot, the thermostat turns off the heat. Once the room cools down, the thermostat turns the heat back on. This is a simple example of feedback, where the room's temperature (output) affects the thermostat's settings (input).",
