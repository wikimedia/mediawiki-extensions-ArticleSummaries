	"summary": "Samurai were Japanese warriors who served nobles and the imperial court. They became a powerful political force until the late 1870s. Originally recruited from wealthy peasants, they fought off Mongol invaders and later became a hereditary class. During peaceful times, they managed estates and could be promoted from other social classes. In the 1870s, the samurai class was abolished, and many became professionals or entrepreneurs. Today, their legacy lives on in Japanese culture.",
