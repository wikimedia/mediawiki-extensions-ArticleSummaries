	"summary": "Tsetse flies are large biting flies found mostly in tropical Africa. They belong to the genus Glossina and are known for spreading diseases like human and animal trypanosomiasis. Tsetse flies are unique because they fold their wings completely over their abdomens when resting and have a long proboscis. They are important because they can cause serious health problems in people and animals. Fossil records show they existed millions of years ago, and today, there are 23 known species in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.",
