	"summary": "Rotten Tomatoes is a website that collects and summarizes reviews for movies and TV shows. It was created in 1998 by three UC Berkeley students. The name comes from a movie scene where rotten tomatoes are thrown as a sign of disapproval.\n\nThe site is popular among movie-goers, but it has been criticized for simplifying reviews too much and for being easily influenced by movie studios. It has changed hands a few times and is now owned by Fandango, a ticketing company.",
