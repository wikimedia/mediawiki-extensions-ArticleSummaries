	"summary": "Liberia is a West African country with a unique history. It was founded in the 19th century by freed African-American slaves and Afro-Caribbeans, who established a colony with American influence. This group, known as Americo-Liberians, declared independence in 1847, making Liberia Africa's oldest modern republic.\n\nThe country faced challenges with indigenous peoples and political turmoil, leading to civil wars in the late 20th century. These conflicts caused immense destruction and loss of life. Since the 2003 peace agreement, Liberia has been rebuilding and has held democratic elections. Today, it is home to over 5 million people, with English as the official language and a diverse culture.",
