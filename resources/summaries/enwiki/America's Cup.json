	"summary": "The America's Cup is the oldest international sailing race, held between two yacht clubs. The winner gets the trophy, called the Auld Mug. Races happen every few years, with the last one in 2021 won by New Zealand. Any yacht club can challenge, and if they win, they get to keep the cup. It's a big deal, attracting top sailors and designers, but it's also very expensive. The next race will be in 2024 in Barcelona, Spain.",
