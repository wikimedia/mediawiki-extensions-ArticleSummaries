Classical Greece, famous for its philosophy, art, and democracy, began with the Greco-Persian Wars. Alexander the Great later united Greece and conquered much of Asia. Greek culture had a big impact on ancient Rome and is seen as the start of Western civilization. The Parthenon in Athens is a famous symbol of this era.",
