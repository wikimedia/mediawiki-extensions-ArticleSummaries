	"summary": "Bayes' theorem helps us understand the probability of an event happening based on related information. It lets us calculate the chance of something occurring when we know the results or effects. For example, it can help predict health risks for a specific age group. This theorem is useful in many areas, like medicine, where it considers disease prevalence and test errors to interpret test results accurately. It's a powerful tool for making informed decisions when dealing with uncertainty.",
