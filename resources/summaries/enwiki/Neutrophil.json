	"summary": "Neutrophils are white blood cells that are our body's first line of defense against infections, especially bacterial ones. They are the most common type of white blood cell in humans, making up 40% to 70% of the total. These cells are formed in the bone marrow and are known for their short life span (5 to 135 hours) and high mobility.\n\nDuring inflammation, neutrophils quickly move towards the affected area, following chemical signals. They are found in pus, giving it a yellow color. While they are great at responding quickly, they might need help from other immune cells to fight certain infections.",
