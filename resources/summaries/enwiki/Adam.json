	"summary": "Adam is a central figure in the book of Genesis, considered the first human. In Christianity, Adam's sin in the Garden of Eden brought death and sin into the world, and only through Jesus' sacrifice can humanity be saved. In Islam, Adam is seen as God's representative on Earth, and his sin, similar to the Biblical story, led to humanity's expulsion from the garden, but he was forgiven through repentance. Gnostics, however, view Adam's physical creation negatively, believing his soul was trapped in a bodily \"prison.\"",
