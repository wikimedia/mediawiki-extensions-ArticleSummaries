	"summary": "From 1920 to 1933, the U.S. had Prohibition, which made it illegal to make, sell, or transport alcohol. This was done to reduce alcohol-related problems like alcoholism and violence. The 18th Amendment made Prohibition official, but it was later ended by the 21st Amendment in 1933.\n\nPeople who supported Prohibition, called \"drys,\" wanted to improve public morals and health. But others, called \"wets,\" opposed it, especially Catholic and German communities. Over time, many people started to disagree with Prohibition, saying it hurt the economy and didn't actually stop people from drinking.",
