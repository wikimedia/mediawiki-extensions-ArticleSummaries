	"summary": "ASCII, pronounced \"ass-kee,\" stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. It's a way to represent text using numbers in computers and other devices. ASCII has 128 codes, but only 95 are used for printable characters. This limitation affected how computer languages and text formatting work. Despite its age, ASCII is still important, and its first 128 codes are the foundation for modern character sets like Unicode.",
