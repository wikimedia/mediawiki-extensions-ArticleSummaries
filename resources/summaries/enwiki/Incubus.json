	"summary": "An incubus is a mythical creature, a male demon disguised as a human. It tries to have sex with sleeping women. The female version is called a succubus. People in medieval Europe believed that incubus-human unions could produce witches, demons, or deformed children. Some stories even suggest that famous figures like Merlin were born from such encounters. Having repeated sex with an incubus or succubus was thought to be dangerous, possibly leading to poor health or even death.",
