	"summary": "Io is one of Jupiter's moons, discovered by Galileo in 1610. It's a small, rocky moon with a big surprise: over 400 active volcanoes! This makes Io the most geologically active place in our solar system. Its volcanoes create colorful surface features and a thin atmosphere. Io's unique composition includes a molten core and a crust with huge mountains. Scientists have studied Io with spacecraft like Voyager, Galileo, and Hubble, learning about its extreme geology and its impact on Jupiter's magnetic field.",
