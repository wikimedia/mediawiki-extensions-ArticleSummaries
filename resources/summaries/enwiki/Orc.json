	"summary": "In J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth stories, orcs (sometimes spelled \"ork\") are ugly, mean, and aggressive monsters. They're the opposite of the kind Elves. Tolkien said orcs might have been corrupted elves or created by evil beings. He liked the name \"orc\" because it sounded right. Orcs in his stories are so evil that it's okay to defeat them. This idea of orcs has been used in many other fantasy books and games.",
