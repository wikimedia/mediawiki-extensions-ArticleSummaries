	"summary": "Six is a special number in math. It comes after five and before seven. One cool thing about six is that it's made up of other numbers (like 2 and 3), which makes it a \"composite\" number. Plus, it's the smallest \"perfect\" number, meaning the sum of its divisors (the numbers that divide evenly into it) is equal to the number itself. So, 1 + 2 + 3 = 6!",
