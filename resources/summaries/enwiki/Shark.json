	"summary": "Sharks are a diverse group of fish with a unique cartilaginous skeleton. They have been around for millions of years, with the earliest modern sharks appearing in the Jurassic period. Sharks come in various sizes, from the tiny 6.7-inch dwarf lanternshark to the massive 40-foot whale shark, the largest fish on Earth. They live in oceans worldwide, usually in saltwater, but some, like the bull shark, can survive in both salt and freshwater. Sharks have special skin that helps them swim efficiently and are apex predators, meaning they are at the top of their food chain. Unfortunately, many shark species are at risk due to overfishing.",
