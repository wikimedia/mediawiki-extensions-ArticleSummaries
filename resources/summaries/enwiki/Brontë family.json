	"summary": "The Brontë sisters—Charlotte, Emily, and Anne—were famous writers in the 1800s. They grew up in Yorkshire, England, and loved to tell stories together. After their mother and older sisters died, they kept writing. They used fake names like Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell. Their books, like *Jane Eyre* and *Wuthering Heights*, were very popular. People still love their stories today, and their home is now a museum that many people visit.",
