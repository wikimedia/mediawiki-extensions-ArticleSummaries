	"summary": "The Second Boer War was a conflict between the British Empire and the Boer republics (South African Republic and Orange Free State) over control of southern Africa. It started due to tensions over gold rush immigrants from the Cape Colony, who were denied voting rights in the South African Republic. Initial Boer attacks were successful, but the British eventually won with a large force. They annexed the Boer republics in 1900, but Boer fighters continued as guerrillas.\n\nThe British used harsh tactics, including concentration camps where many civilians died. Eventually, the Boers surrendered, leading to the formation of the Union of South Africa in 1910. The war was controversial, with international criticism of British actions.",
