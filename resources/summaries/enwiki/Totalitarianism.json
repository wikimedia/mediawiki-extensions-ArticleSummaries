	"summary": "Totalitarianism is a strict type of government where one leader or group has complete control. It doesn't allow any opposing political parties or voices. This system controls every part of life, including politics, the economy, education, and even personal lives. The government uses propaganda to influence people's thoughts and actions. \n\nIn totalitarian regimes, the leader often has a strong personality cult and a clear set of beliefs they want everyone to follow. It's different from authoritarianism, where the leader might just want power without a clear ideology.",
