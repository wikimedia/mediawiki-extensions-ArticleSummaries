	"summary": "Anemia is a blood problem where your blood can't carry enough oxygen. This can happen if you have fewer red blood cells, not enough hemoglobin (the oxygen-carrying protein), or hemoglobin that doesn't work well. It can make you feel tired, weak, and short of breath.\n\nThere are different types and causes, like blood loss, not making enough red blood cells, or them breaking down too fast. Treatment depends on the cause. Iron-deficiency anemia is the most common type worldwide.\n\nIt's important to find and treat the cause rather than just take iron pills without knowing the reason for your anemia.",
