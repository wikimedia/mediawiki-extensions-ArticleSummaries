	"summary": "Skara Brae is an ancient village in Scotland, dating back to around 3180 BC. It's located on the Orkney Islands and is made up of ten stone houses, with beds, hearths, and even early toilets! The village is well-preserved and gives us a glimpse into life in the Neolithic era. It's so unique that it's now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nThe site was discovered after a storm in 1850 and is now managed by Historic Environment Scotland. Visitors can explore this ancient settlement, but climate change poses a threat to its future.",
