	"summary": "\"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star\" is an English lullaby with lyrics written by Jane Taylor in the early 1800s. The poem, first published in 1806, is now sung to a French melody from 1761. Although the song has five stanzas, only the first one is commonly known. There's a debate about where Jane wrote the lyrics, with two towns claiming the honor. However, it's likely she wrote it before ever visiting the towns.",
