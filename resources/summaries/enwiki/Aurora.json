	"summary": "An aurora, like the northern or southern lights, is a beautiful natural phenomenon. It appears as colorful, dancing lights in the sky, mainly near Earth's poles. This happens when the Sun's wind disturbs Earth's magnetic field, sending charged particles into the atmosphere. These particles excite atoms and molecules, making them glow. The result is a stunning display of curtains, rays, and spirals of light. Other planets and even comets can have similar light shows!",
