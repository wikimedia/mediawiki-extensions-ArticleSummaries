	"summary": "An integral is a math concept used to find areas, volumes, and more. It's like adding up tiny bits to get a total. In a graph, it's the area between the curve and the horizontal line. Positive areas are above the line, and negative areas are below.\n\nIsaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz first came up with these ideas, and later, mathematicians like Bernhard Riemann and Henri Lebesgue made them more precise. Integrals are super useful in math, physics, and many other sciences. They can be adjusted for different types of functions and shapes, like line and surface integrals.",
