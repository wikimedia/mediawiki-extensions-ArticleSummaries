	"summary": "The February Revolution happened in Russia in 1917, leading to the end of the Romanov dynasty. It started in Petrograd with protests against food rationing and turned into violent clashes. The army joined the protesters, causing Tsar Nicholas II to step down. This led to a new government, the Russian Provisional Government, but it faced many challenges like food shortages. The revolution's main cause was Russia's problems during World War I, along with social and economic issues. It set the stage for the later October Revolution.",
