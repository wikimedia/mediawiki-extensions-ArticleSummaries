	"summary": "A shogun was the military leader of Japan from 1185 to 1868. They were appointed by the emperor but often held the real power. The title was usually passed down within families, but not always. Minamoto no Yoritomo was the first shogun to rule in the typical sense. While the Minamoto clan was preferred, other clans also held the position. The shogun's government, called the bakufu, handled day-to-day rule, while the emperor had little actual power. The shogunate system lasted until 1867 when the last shogun gave up his power.",
