	"summary": "A lingam is a symbol of the Hindu god Shiva, often seen as a short, cylindrical pillar. It's usually placed on a flat base called a yoni, which represents the female energy. Together, they symbolize the union of male and female, creation, and the power of nature. Lingams can be made of different materials and are found in Shiva temples and small shrines. They are considered very sacred and are used for worship. The lingam's shape may look like a penis, but it's more about representing the power and mystery of life and the universe.",
