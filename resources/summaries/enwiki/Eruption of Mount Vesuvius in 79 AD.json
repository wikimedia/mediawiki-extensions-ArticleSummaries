	"summary": "The most famous eruption of Mount Vesuvius in Italy happened in 79 AD. It was one of the worst volcanic disasters ever. The volcano shot out super-hot ash and rocks very fast, reaching high into the sky. This type of eruption is now called \"Vesuvian.\"\n\nThe explosion destroyed many Roman towns, especially Pompeii and Herculaneum. These cities were buried under ash and are now important archaeological sites. Over 1,500 human remains have been found, but the total number of deaths is still unknown. The area is now a national park and a special place recognized by UNESCO.",
