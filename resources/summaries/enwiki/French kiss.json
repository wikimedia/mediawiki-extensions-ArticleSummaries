	"summary": "## French Kissing\n\nFrench kissing is when two people stick their tongues out and touch each other's tongues or lips. It's a way to show love and can make people feel excited. This type of kiss started being called \"French\" in the early 1900s because people thought the French had more adventurous love lives. Be careful though, because French kissing can sometimes spread germs, especially if someone has an open cut.",
