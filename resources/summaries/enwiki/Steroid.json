	"summary": "Steroids are organic compounds made of four connected rings, often found in nature. They play vital roles in living organisms, like adjusting cell membrane fluidity and sending signals. Examples include cholesterol, sex hormones (estradiol, testosterone), and medications like dexamethasone.\n\nThe core of a steroid is called gonane, typically with 17 carbon atoms in four rings. Steroids can vary in structure due to different functional groups and ring modifications. For instance, secosteroids, including vitamin D3, are formed when one of the rings is broken.",
