	"summary": "Spiders are air-breathing arthropods with eight legs, fangs, and silk-producing spinnerets. They are everywhere except Antarctica and come in over 52,000 species! Spiders have two main body parts: the head-thorax (cephalothorax) and the abdomen. They have a unique way of moving their legs using hydraulic pressure instead of muscles.\n\nSpiders are hunters, mostly eating insects. Some make webs, while others chase their prey. They have various tactics, like lassoing or mimicking prey. Spiders reproduce through courtship rituals, and females often care for their young. Some species live in groups, showing different social behaviors.",
