	"summary": "The Holy See is the central leadership of the Catholic Church, based in Vatican City, Rome. It is led by the Pope, who is considered the spiritual leader of all Catholics worldwide. Founded by Saints Peter and Paul, it holds a special position in Catholic tradition. The Roman Curia, headed by the Cardinal Secretary of State, helps manage the Church's affairs. The Holy See is recognized internationally as a sovereign entity, with diplomatic relations and representation in many countries and international organizations. It's important to note that while often used interchangeably, the Holy See and Vatican City State are not exactly the same, with the latter being a distinct entity established in 1929.",
