	"summary": "The Revolutions of 1848 were a series of uprisings across Europe, starting in Italy and spreading to over 50 countries. People wanted more democracy, freedom of the press, and economic rights. They also wanted to create independent nations based on their cultural identities. The revolutions were led by workers and reformers from different social classes. While some changes were made, like ending serfdom in Austria and Hungary, many revolutions were quickly stopped, leading to deaths and exiles. The wave of revolutions ended in 1849.",
