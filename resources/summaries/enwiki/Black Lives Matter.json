	"summary": "Black Lives Matter (BLM) is a movement against racism and violence against Black people, especially by the police. It started in 2013 after Trayvon Martin's killer was acquitted. The movement gained a lot of attention in 2020 after George Floyd's murder. BLM has many groups and protests, but no single leader. They want changes in the justice system and an end to racial inequality. Most BLM protests are peaceful, and many people support the movement, though this support has decreased over time.",
