	"summary": "Lobotomy is a controversial brain surgery that was once used to treat mental health disorders. It involves cutting connections in the front part of the brain. This procedure was created by Dr. Ant√≥nio Egas Moniz, who won a Nobel Prize for it in 1949. However, many people disagreed with this treatment, as it didn't fully understand the seriousness of mental illnesses.\n\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, lobotomies were very common, especially in the United States and the United Kingdom. But over time, doctors stopped using this method, realizing it wasn't helpful and could be harmful. Many women and gay men underwent this surgery during that period.",
