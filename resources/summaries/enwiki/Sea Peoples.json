	"summary": "Around 1175 BC, ancient Egyptian king Ramesses III fought a battle against mysterious warriors called the Sea Peoples. This event is shown in a famous wall painting at Medinet Habu. The Sea Peoples came from different places in the Mediterranean, like the Aegean Sea and Western Anatolia. They attacked Egypt and other regions around 1200 BC, causing chaos and destruction. Scholars believe they might have contributed to the end of the Bronze Age. Although we know some groups' names, like the Lukka, many of the Sea Peoples' origins remain a mystery.",
