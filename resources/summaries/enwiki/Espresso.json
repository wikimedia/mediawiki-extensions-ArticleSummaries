	"summary": "Espresso is a strong coffee made by pushing hot water through fine coffee powder. It comes from Italy and is popular worldwide. It's small (about 1-2 shots) with a creamy foam called crema. Espresso machines use pressure to make it quickly, giving it a rich taste. You can use different coffee beans and roasts to change the flavor. Baristas need skills to make good espresso. Despite its strength, one serving has less caffeine than a big cup of drip coffee. Espresso is important in coffee shop culture and for making drinks like lattes and cappuccinos.",
