	"summary": "Root beer is a sweet, carbonated soft drink from North America. It's traditionally made with sassafras or sarsaparilla roots. Most root beers are non-alcoholic, caffeine-free, and have a foamy head. They often make root beer floats by mixing it with vanilla ice cream.\n\nIn the 1960s, a chemical in sassafras was found to be harmful, so now most root beers use artificial flavoring. Some brands still use a safe sassafras extract. Big companies like Pepsi and Coca-Cola make root beer, along with others like Dad's and A&W.",
