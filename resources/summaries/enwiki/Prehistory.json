	"summary": "Prehistory is the time before people started writing things down. It began with the use of stone tools over 3 million years ago and ended when writing was invented around 5,200 years ago. This period is divided into three ages: Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age.\n\nSome ancient civilizations, like Sumer and Egypt, were the first to write and record history. Others took longer, and their prehistory ended later. For example, Australia's prehistory ended in the 18th century. We learn about prehistory through archaeology, studying old objects and remains, and figuring out how old they are.",
