	"summary": "The Lagonda Taraf is a fancy, big car made by Aston Martin in 2015 and 2016. It's really fast, going from 0 to 62 mph in 4.4 seconds, and can go up to 195 mph. The car has a strong 5.9-liter engine and an automatic gearbox. It was first shown in Dubai and was meant for the Middle East, but later, more were made for other countries. Only 120 were built, and it was very expensive, costing over $1 million. People liked how it handled but thought the price was too high.",
