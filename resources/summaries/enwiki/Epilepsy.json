	"summary": "Epilepsy is a brain disorder that causes repeated seizures. Seizures happen when there's unusual electrical activity in the brain, leading to symptoms like shaking or losing consciousness. It can be scary to witness, but it's not contagious. Epilepsy has many causes, like brain injuries or genetics, but sometimes the cause is unknown. \n\nDoctors use tests like EEGs (brain wave tests) to diagnose it. Most people with epilepsy can manage it with medicine, and some might need surgery or diet changes. It's important to remember that people with epilepsy can live full lives, and many outgrow it.",
