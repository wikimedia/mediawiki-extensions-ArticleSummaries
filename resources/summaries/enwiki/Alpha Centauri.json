	"summary": "Alpha Centauri is a triple star system in the Centaurus constellation. It includes three stars: Rigil Kentaurus (the brightest), Toliman, and Proxima Centauri, which is the closest star to our Sun. \n\nThe first two stars are similar to our Sun and orbit each other, while Proxima is a small, faint red dwarf. Scientists have found planets orbiting Proxima Centauri, including one in the habitable zone, where life could exist. The system is an exciting area of study for astronomers.",
