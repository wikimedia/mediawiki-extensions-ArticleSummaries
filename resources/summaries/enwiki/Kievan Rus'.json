	"summary": "Kievan Rus' was an ancient state in Eastern Europe, existing from the 9th to the 13th century. It was the first East Slavic state, ruled by the Rurik dynasty. The name comes from the city of Kiev, its main center. At its peak, Kievan Rus' united many East Slavic tribes and stretched from the White Sea to the Black Sea. Powerful rulers like Oleg, Sviatoslav, and Yaroslav expanded its territory and spread Christianity. However, it started to decline in the 11th century due to internal conflicts and external trade changes. The Mongol invasion in the 13th century ended Kievan Rus', but its legacy lives on in modern Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine.",
