	"summary": "Linux is a popular computer operating system (OS) that is free and open-source. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991 and is similar to Unix. Linux is unique because anyone can use, change, and share its code. It's often combined with other software from the GNU Project, and these collections are called distributions (or \"distros\").\n\nYou'll find Linux on many devices, from personal computers to smartphones (through Android) and even supercomputers. It's very popular on servers, and it's used in many different types of technology, like smart TVs, cars, and space missions.",
