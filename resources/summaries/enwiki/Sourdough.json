	"summary": "Sourdough is a type of bread with a tangy flavor. It's made using a natural mix of wild bacteria and yeast, called a starter. This process, called fermentation, creates lactic acid, which makes the bread taste slightly sour. The same acid also helps the bread stay fresh for longer. Unlike regular bread, sourdough doesn't use commercial yeast, giving it a unique taste and texture.",
