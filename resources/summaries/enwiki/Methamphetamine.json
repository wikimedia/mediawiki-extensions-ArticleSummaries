	"summary": "Methamphetamine is a strong stimulant mostly used as a recreational drug, but it can also treat ADHD and obesity. It was discovered in 1893 and is often called \"crystal meth.\" The drug can be used safely in small doses to improve mood and focus, but high doses can cause serious problems like psychosis and seizures. It is highly addictive and can lead to dependence. \n\nMethamphetamine is illegal in many countries due to its potential for abuse. It is made up of two similar forms (enantiomers), with dextro-methamphetamine being the stronger one.",
