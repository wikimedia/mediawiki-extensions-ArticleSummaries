	"summary": "Rosicrucianism is a spiritual movement that started in Europe around the 1600s. It began after some mysterious texts were published, talking about a secret group with special knowledge. The symbol of this group is a rose and a cross. Over time, different groups have used the name Rosicrucian, like the Order of the Golden and Rosy Cross and the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. These groups often have secret rituals and believe in hidden wisdom.",
