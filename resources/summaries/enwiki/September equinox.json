	"summary": "The September equinox is when the Sun appears to move across the Earth's equator, heading south. This can happen between September 21 and 24. On this day, the Sun rises in the east and sets in the west for people living on the equator. Before the equinox, the Sun rises and sets more to the north, and after, it does so more to the south. This event marks the start of autumn in the Northern Hemisphere and the beginning of spring in the Southern Hemisphere.",
