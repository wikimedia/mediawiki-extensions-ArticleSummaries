	"summary": "Jellyfish are fascinating marine animals with a simple body structure: a bell-shaped main body and trailing tentacles. They swim by pulsating their bells and use tentacles to capture prey or defend against predators. Jellyfish have a unique life cycle, with the medusa (jellyfish) being the sexual phase. They are found worldwide, from the surface to the deep sea, and some are even eaten as a delicacy in Asia. Despite their beauty, jellyfish stings can hurt humans, and large swarms can cause problems for fishing and power plants.",
