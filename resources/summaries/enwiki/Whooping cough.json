	"summary": "Whooping cough, also called pertussis, is a serious bacterial infection that causes severe coughing fits. It's highly contagious and can be prevented by a vaccine. Symptoms start like a cold but lead to intense coughing that can last for months, making a \"whoop\" sound when the person breathes in. It's most dangerous for babies under one year old. Vaccination is the best way to prevent it, with initial shots given to infants and booster doses for older children and adults. Antibiotics can help if started early.",
