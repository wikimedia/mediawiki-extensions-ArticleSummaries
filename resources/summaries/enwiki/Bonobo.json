	"summary": "Bonobos are great apes and one of two species in the genus Pan, the other being common chimpanzees. Initially thought to be a subspecies of chimpanzees, they are now recognized as distinct. Bonobos have long limbs, pink lips, and darker faces compared to chimpanzees. They live in the Congo Basin of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and eat mostly fruit. With an estimated population of 29,500 to 50,000, bonobos are endangered due to habitat loss, poaching, and political unrest. They are our closest living relatives, along with chimpanzees, and have been isolated from them by the Congo River for about 2 million years.",
