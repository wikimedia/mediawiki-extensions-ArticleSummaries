In dystopian stories, governments are often cruel and control people using propaganda and force. People might not be able to think freely or be themselves. \n\nFamous books like *Nineteen Eighty-Four* and *Fahrenheit 451* show dystopian worlds. These stories can teach us about real-world problems and warn us about what could happen if things go wrong.",
