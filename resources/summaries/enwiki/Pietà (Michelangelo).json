	"summary": "The Madonna della Pietà, or Pietà, is a famous marble sculpture by Michelangelo. It shows Jesus and Mary at the site of his crucifixion. Mary looks younger than Jesus, which was inspired by a poem by Dante. This artwork is important because it combines naturalism with classical beauty, marking the beginning of the High Renaissance. Originally made for a French cardinal's funeral chapel in St. Peter's Basilica, it's now in the new basilica. It's the only artwork Michelangelo ever signed. It was damaged by a vandal in 1972 but has been restored.",
