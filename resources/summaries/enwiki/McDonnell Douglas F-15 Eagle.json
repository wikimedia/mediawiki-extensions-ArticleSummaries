	"summary": "The F-15 Eagle is a powerful fighter jet made by Boeing (formerly McDonnell Douglas). The U.S. Air Force chose this plane in 1969 for its air superiority. It first flew in 1972 and has won over 100 battles without losing any. Many countries, like Israel and Japan, use it. Though designed for air fights, it can also attack targets on the ground. An updated version, the F-15E Strike Eagle, does this well. The F-15 is still used today, and new models are being made.",
