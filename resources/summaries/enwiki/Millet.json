	"summary": "Millets are a group of small grass seeds, often used as food and animal feed. They grow well in hot, dry places and have a short growing season. Pearl millet is the most common type, but others like finger, proso, and foxtail millet are also important crops.\n\nThese crops are crucial in many countries, especially in Asia and Africa, where they provide food and help farmers in dry areas. People have been eating millets for thousands of years, and they may have been key to starting farming communities.",
