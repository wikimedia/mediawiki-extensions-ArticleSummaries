Originally planned for September 10, it was rescheduled to avoid clashing with a presidential debate. The event honored music videos, artists, and songs released between June 2023 and June 2024, introducing two new fan-voted categories. Taylor Swift dominated, winning seven awards, including five for her song with Post Malone, \"Fortnight.\" Katy Perry received the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award. The ceremony attracted 4.08 million viewers, an 8% increase from the previous year, and was streamed on Vix and aired on UniMÃ¡s.",
