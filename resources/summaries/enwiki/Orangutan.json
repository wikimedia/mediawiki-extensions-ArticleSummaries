	"summary": "Orangutans are large, tree-dwelling apes from Indonesia and Malaysia. They used to live across Southeast Asia but now are only found on parts of Borneo and Sumatra. There are three species: Bornean, Sumatran, and Tapanuli. Orangutans are very intelligent and use tools. They mainly eat fruit and live in trees, having reddish-brown hair and long arms. Adult males can weigh up to 165 pounds and have large cheek pads. Orangutans are endangered due to habitat loss, poaching, and the illegal pet trade.",
