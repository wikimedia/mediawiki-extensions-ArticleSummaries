	"summary": "\"Until Dawn\" is a 2015 horror game where you control eight friends trying to survive on a mountain. Your choices affect the story, and characters can live or die. You explore in third-person, finding clues to solve a mystery. Originally planned for PlayStation 3's motion controller, it became a PlayStation 4 game with improved graphics. Famous actors lent their voices, and the team tested how scary it was using special methods. Released in 2015, it did well despite little marketing. Critics liked its story, choices, and characters, but criticized the controls. It led to spin-offs and a prequel, with a remake coming in 2024 and a movie in the works.",
