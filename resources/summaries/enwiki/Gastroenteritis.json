	"summary": "Gastroenteritis is an upset stomach that can cause diarrhea, vomiting, and tummy pain. It's often called \"stomach flu,\" but it's not related to the flu. Viruses are usually the culprit, but bacteria and parasites can also cause it. Rotavirus is common in kids, while norovirus and Campylobacter affect adults.\n\nYou can catch it from eating bad food, drinking dirty water, or being near someone who's sick. It usually goes away on its own in a couple of weeks. Staying hydrated with special rehydration drinks is important. For young kids, washing hands, clean water, and breastfeeding can prevent it. A vaccine for rotavirus is also available.",
