	"summary": "Māori are the indigenous people of New Zealand, originating from East Polynesia around the 14th century. They developed a unique culture with their own language and traditions. Early contact with Europeans brought both trade and violence. The Treaty of Waitangi (1840) aimed for peaceful coexistence, but land disputes led to conflict and Māori assimilation.\n\nToday, Māori are New Zealand's second-largest ethnic group, with nearly 1 million people. They face social and economic challenges but have seen cultural revivals and political representation. Efforts continue to address historical injustices and improve Māori well-being.",
