	"summary": "The Temple Mount, also known as Haram al-Sharif, is a sacred hill in Jerusalem's Old City. It's considered holy by Jews, Christians, and Muslims. The site features the al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock, built in the 7th century, making it a significant Islamic historical location.\n\nFor Jews, it's the holiest place, where two ancient temples stood. Muslims believe it's the third holiest site, where the prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven. The area is managed by the Muslim community but has been controlled by Israel since 1967. Access is restricted, and it remains a sensitive spot in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.",
