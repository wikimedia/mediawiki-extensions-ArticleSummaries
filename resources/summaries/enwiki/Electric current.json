	"summary": "Electric current is the flow of tiny charged particles, like electrons, through a material or space. These particles are called charge carriers. The speed of this flow is measured in amperes (or \"amps\"), which is one coulomb of charge passing by every second. Amps are a basic unit in the metric system. Electric current is important in many ways; it creates magnetic fields, powers devices like light bulbs, and is used to send information through electromagnetic waves in telecommunications.",
