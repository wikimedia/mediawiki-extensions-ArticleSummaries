	"summary": "Katakana is a Japanese writing system, along with hiragana and kanji. It's used for special purposes, like writing foreign words, loanwords, and technical terms. Each character represents a syllable, like \"ka\" or \"a.\" The name means \"fragmentary kana\" because the characters come from parts of kanji (Chinese characters).\n\nMonks developed katakana to help translate Chinese texts. It's like italics in English, used to highlight or show sounds from other languages.",
