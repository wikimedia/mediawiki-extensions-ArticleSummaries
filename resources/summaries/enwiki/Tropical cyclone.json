	"summary": "Tropical cyclones are massive storms with strong, rotating winds. They form over warm ocean water and are fueled by its energy. These storms are known as hurricanes in the Atlantic and northeastern Pacific, and typhoons in the northwestern Pacific. They can cause heavy rain, strong winds, and coastal damage.\n\nClimate change is making these storms more intense and frequent. The warm ocean water and increased moisture in the air lead to stronger and longer-lasting cyclones. This can result in extreme rainfall, flooding, and destruction across vast areas, especially near coastlines.",
