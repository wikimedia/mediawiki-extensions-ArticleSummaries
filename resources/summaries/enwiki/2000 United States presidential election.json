	"summary": "The 2000 U.S. presidential election was a close race between Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore. Bush, the son of a former president, won by a narrow margin, even though Gore got more popular votes. This was because of the controversial results in Florida, where Bush won by a tiny fraction. The election had many twists, including legal battles and a Supreme Court decision. Bush focused on domestic issues, while Gore dealt with Clinton's scandals. In the end, Bush became president, flipping several states that had voted Democratic before.",
