	"summary": "Rhode Island is the smallest state in the U.S., located in the northeast. It borders Connecticut, Massachusetts, and the Atlantic Ocean. With a population of around 1.1 million, it's the seventh least populous state but has a high population density. The capital is Providence.\n\nEnglish settlers, led by Roger Williams, founded Rhode Island in the 17th century as a refuge for religious freedom. It was the first colony to demand a Continental Congress and deny loyalty to Britain. After the American Revolution, Rhode Island became the fourth state to approve the Articles of Confederation but was the last of the original 13 states to ratify the U.S. Constitution. It's nicknamed \"The Ocean State\" due to its extensive coastline.",
