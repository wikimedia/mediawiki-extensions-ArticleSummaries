	"summary": "Slavs are people who speak Slavic languages and are found mostly in Europe and northern Asia. They have a long history, dating back to the 5th century, and have lived in many medieval kingdoms. Over time, most Slavs became Christian, but some, like the Bosniaks, are Muslim.\n\nThere are three main groups of Slavs: East, South, and West Slavs. Their languages are part of the Indo-European family. Despite sharing a common heritage, Slavic groups can have diverse cultures and genetics, sometimes feeling connected and other times hostile to each other.",
