	"summary": "Parole is when a prisoner can leave prison early, but they must follow specific rules. These rules include meeting with a parole officer regularly. If they break these conditions, they might go back to prison. The word 'parole' comes from French, meaning 'promise.' It's not the same as being forgiven or forgotten; parolees are still serving their sentences. Parole happens after someone has been in prison, while probation is an alternative to prison.",
