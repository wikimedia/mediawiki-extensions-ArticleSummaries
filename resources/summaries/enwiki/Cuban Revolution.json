	"summary": "The Cuban Revolution was a political and military uprising in Cuba against Fulgencio Batista's dictatorship (1952-1959). Led by Fidel and Ra√∫l Castro, the revolution began after Batista's coup in 1952. The Castros' attack on Moncada Barracks in 1953 failed, leading to their arrest and the formation of the 26th of July Movement. After an amnesty, they exiled themselves to Mexico, where they met Che Guevara.\n\nReturning to Cuba in 1956, they fled to the Sierra Maestra mountains and built a strong rebel force. The revolution gained support, and Batista was overthrown in 1958. Castro became the leader, and the 26th of July Movement became the new government. The revolution had major impacts on Cuba's relations with the U.S. and led to economic changes and Cuban involvement in global conflicts.",
