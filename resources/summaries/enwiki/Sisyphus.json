	"summary": "In Greek mythology, Sisyphus was a king who did bad things, like killing guests to show off his power. This made the gods very angry. As punishment, they made him roll a huge rock up a hill forever. The rock would always roll back down before reaching the top. This is why we call hard, useless tasks \"Sisyphean.\" Sisyphus' story is often shown in ancient Greek art.",
