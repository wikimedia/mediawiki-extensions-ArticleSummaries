	"summary": "The Kingdom of Wessex was an important Anglo-Saxon kingdom in southern Britain, lasting from around 519 to 886. It was founded by Cerdic and Cynric, though this story is considered a legend by some. Wessex became Christian under King Cenwalh and expanded its territory. During the 8th century, it maintained independence as Mercia's power grew. King Egbert conquered neighboring kingdoms, and Alfred the Great, his successor, defeated the Danish invaders, issued new laws, and strengthened the kingdom. Alfred's son, Edward, unified England, and Wessex eventually became part of a unified kingdom under Cnut the Great.",
