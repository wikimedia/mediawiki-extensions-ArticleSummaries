	"summary": "The terms \"Anno Domini\" (AD) and \"Before Christ\" (BC) are used to mark years on our calendars. AD means \"in the year of our Lord\" and counts years from the estimated birth of Jesus. BC is used for years before this event. There is no year zero; so, AD 1 comes after 1 BC. This system was created in the 6th century but became popular much later. Some people use \"Common Era\" (CE) and \"Before the Common Era\" (BCE) to be more inclusive, especially in astronomy.",
