	"summary": "Sine and cosine are math functions used to describe angles in triangles. In a right triangle, sine is the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse (longest side), while cosine is the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse. These functions are often used to model repeating patterns like waves or seasonal changes.\n\nOver time, the definitions of sine and cosine have been expanded to work with any angle, even negative or complex numbers, using a shape called a unit circle.",
