	"summary": "Indra is the king of the gods in Hinduism. He controls the sky, weather, and storms, and is famous for killing a bad demon called Vritra to bring rain and sunshine. Though less important in later stories, he's still a big deal in Hindu mythology.\n\nHe's also found in Buddhist and Jain stories, but his power is reduced.  Think of him like Zeus from Greek mythology.  Indra's symbol is the vajra (thunderbolt) and he rides a magical elephant.",
