	"summary": "Agnosticism is the idea that it's impossible to know for sure if God or any supernatural beings exist. It suggests that human understanding has its limits, especially when it comes to such complex topics. The term was first used by scientist Thomas Henry Huxley in the 19th century to describe his uncertainty about God's existence and other unknowns. This philosophy has roots in ancient times, with thinkers like Sanjaya Belatthiputta and Protagoras also expressing similar views.",
