	"summary": "The Philistines were an ancient group who lived in Canaan (modern-day Israel and Palestine) during the Iron Age. They came from Greece around 1175 BC and mixed with the local Canaanite people. They had their own culture and were known for their conflicts with the Israelites. Over time, they were ruled by different empires and lost their independence. By the 5th century BC, they had blended into other cultures and disappeared as a separate group. We learn about them from the Hebrew Bible and ancient records.",
