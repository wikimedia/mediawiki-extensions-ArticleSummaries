	"summary": "Staten Island is a borough in New York City, located at the city's southernmost point. It's the least populated but third largest borough by area. Originally home to the Lenape people, it was settled by Dutch colonists and later became one of New York's first counties. Now, it's known for its many parks and sometimes feels overlooked by the city. The island has distinct areas: an urban North Shore, a scenic East Shore with a long boardwalk, a suburban South Shore, and an industrial West Shore. It's connected to Brooklyn and New Jersey by bridges and has its own railway and ferry to Manhattan.",
