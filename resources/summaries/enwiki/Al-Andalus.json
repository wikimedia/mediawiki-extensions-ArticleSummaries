	"summary": "Al-Andalus was a Muslim-ruled area in Spain and Portugal for over 700 years. It started as part of the Umayyad Caliphate and later became the Emirate of Granada. At its peak, it covered most of the Iberian Peninsula. The capital, CÃ³rdoba, was a major cultural hub. Muslims and Christians lived side by side, sharing knowledge in science and art.\n\nOver time, Christian kingdoms took back the land, with the last Muslim state, Granada, surrendering in 1492. This period is known as the Reconquista. Al-Andalus left a lasting impact on Spain's culture and history.",
