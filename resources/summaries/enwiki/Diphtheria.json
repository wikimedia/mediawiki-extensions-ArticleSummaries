	"summary": "Diphtheria is a serious infection caused by bacteria. It can lead to a sore throat, fever, and even trouble breathing. In severe cases, a gray patch forms in the throat, and it can feel like there's a barky cough. You might also notice swollen lymph nodes in the neck.\n\nThis disease spreads through direct contact, the air, or touching infected objects. A vaccine can prevent it, and antibiotics like erythromycin can treat it. Diphtheria used to be very common, but with vaccination, the number of cases has dropped worldwide.",
