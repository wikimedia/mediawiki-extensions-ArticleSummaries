	"summary": "The liver is a vital organ in vertebrates, including humans. It's like a super-factory in your body, doing many important jobs. It helps get rid of bad stuff (detoxification), makes proteins and other important substances, and breaks down food so your body can use it. The liver also produces bile, which helps digest fat. It's located on the right side of your belly, protected by your ribs. If the liver stops working, a transplant is needed, as there's no long-term replacement for it yet.",
