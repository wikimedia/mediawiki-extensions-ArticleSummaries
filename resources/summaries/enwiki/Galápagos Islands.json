They belong to Ecuador and are known for their unique animals and plants that live nowhere else on Earth. Charles Darwin, a famous scientist, studied these species, which helped him develop his theory of evolution.\n\nThe islands were discovered by accident in 1535 and were later claimed by Ecuador in 1832. Over time, people from different countries visited, including pirates and explorers. Today, the Galápagos are protected as a national park, and many people visit to see the amazing wildlife.",
