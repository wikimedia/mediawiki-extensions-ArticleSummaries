	"summary": "## The Troubles in Northern Ireland\n\nThe Troubles was a long conflict in Northern Ireland between 1968 and 1998. It was mostly between two groups: unionists (mostly Protestant) who wanted Northern Ireland to stay part of the UK, and nationalists (mostly Catholic) who wanted to join Ireland.\n\nViolence started when civil rights protests against discrimination were met with police brutality. This led to riots and the British Army being sent in. Paramilitary groups like the IRA and UVF also fought, causing many deaths.\n\nThe conflict ended with the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, which created a new government where both sides share power.",
