	"summary": "Eris is a huge dwarf planet in our solar system, even bigger than Pluto. It's about 2,326 kilometers (1,445 miles) across and has a moon called Dysnomia. Eris is so far away from the Sun, it's even farther than Neptune and Pluto. Because it's so big, NASA first thought it might be a new planet. But in 2006, scientists decided that Eris, Pluto, and Ceres are actually dwarf planets. This means there are only eight official planets in our solar system.",
