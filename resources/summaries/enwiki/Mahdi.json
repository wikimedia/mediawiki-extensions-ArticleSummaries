According to some Islamic texts, he will be a descendant of the Prophet Muhammad. The idea of the Mahdi emerged during early Islamic political turmoil. While mentioned in some hadiths, the Mahdi is not found in the Quran or the two main Sunni hadith collections. Shia and Sunni Muslims have different views on his identity; Shias believe he is already alive and hidden, while Sunnis think he has not been born yet.",
