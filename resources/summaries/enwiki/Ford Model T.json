	"summary": "The Ford Model T, also known as the \"Tin Lizzie,\" was a car made between 1908 and 1927. It was the first car that many middle-class people could afford, costing around $780 at first and dropping to $290 later on. This was possible because of new ways of making cars, like using an assembly line. It was designed by Joseph Galamb, Eugene Farkas, and Childe Wills. The Model T was named the most important car of the 20th century and sold over 15 million units.",
