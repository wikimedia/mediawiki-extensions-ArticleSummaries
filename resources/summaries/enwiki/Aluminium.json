When exposed to air, it forms a protective oxide layer. Aluminum is soft, non-magnetic, and can be easily shaped.\n\nFound mostly in rocks, aluminum is the third most abundant element in Earth's crust. People first made aluminum in 1825, and it's now widely used in many products, like planes, cars, and cans. It's also safe for plants and animals.
