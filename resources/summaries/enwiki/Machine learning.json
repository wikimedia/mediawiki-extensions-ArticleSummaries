	"summary": "## Machine Learning Simplified\n\nMachine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence that teaches computers to learn from data. Instead of being directly programmed, ML algorithms discover patterns and make predictions from examples.\n\nDeep learning, a recent advance in ML, has made computers better at tasks like understanding language, recognizing images, and filtering emails. ML is used in many areas, like medicine, business, and agriculture. It's built on math and statistics, and a key idea is that these algorithms can learn to be \"probably approximately correct.\"",
