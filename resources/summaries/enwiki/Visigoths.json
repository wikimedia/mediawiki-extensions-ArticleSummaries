	"summary": "The Visigoths were a Germanic tribe who lived in the Roman Empire around 400 AD. They were led by King Alaric I and are known for sacking Rome in 410. Later, they settled in southern France and parts of Spain and Portugal. The Visigoths created beautiful treasures, like the crown of King Recceswinth, and built churches. They originally followed a different form of Christianity called Arianism but later converted to Nicene Christianity. The Visigothic Code, their set of laws, was very important and influenced court procedures in Spain and Portugal for many centuries.",
