	"summary": "Blu-ray is a type of digital storage disc used for high-definition videos and video games. It was created to replace DVDs and can hold more data because it uses a blue laser to read the disc. This allows for better picture quality and more storage space. Blu-ray discs are the same size as DVDs and CDs. They can store 25GB per layer, with double-layer discs being the standard for movies. Newer players can even support up to 4K resolution.",
