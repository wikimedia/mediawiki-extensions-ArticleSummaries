Java code is turned into a special type of code called bytecode, which can run on any computer with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This feature makes Java easy to use and popular for many types of software.\n\nJava was created by James Gosling and released in 1995. It is now owned by Oracle but is mostly open-source, meaning anyone can use and change it. The latest version is Java 23.",
