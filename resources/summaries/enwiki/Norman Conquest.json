	"summary": "The Norman Conquest was an invasion led by Duke William of Normandy, who became William the Conqueror. He claimed the English throne through a family connection to King Edward the Confessor. After Edward's death, Harold Godwinson became king, but was challenged by Norwegian king Harald Hardrada. Godwinson defeated Hardrada but was then confronted by William's army at the Battle of Hastings. William won, becoming England's new king.\n\nWilliam faced rebellions but secured his rule by 1072. He granted lands to his followers, built castles, and created the Domesday Book, a record of England's lands. The Conquest changed the language of the elites to French and altered the upper classes. It also likely ended slavery and kept much of the existing government structure.",
