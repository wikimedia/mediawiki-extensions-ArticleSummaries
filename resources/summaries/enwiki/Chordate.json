	"summary": "Chordates are a group of animals with some unique features. They all have a notochord, a nerve cord, a special throat structure, slits in the throat, and a tail extending beyond the anus at some point in their lives. These characteristics set them apart from other animals. Chordates include vertebrates (animals with backbones) like fish, birds, and mammals, as well as tunicates (sea squirts) and cephalochordates (lancelets).\n\nScientists also identify chordates by looking at their DNA, which has specific markers. This group is one of the largest and oldest in the animal kingdom, with fossils dating back millions of years.",
