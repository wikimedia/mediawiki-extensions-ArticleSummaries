	"summary": "## Summary\n\nThe Boltzmann constant (k) helps us understand how much energy particles in a gas have at different temperatures. It's like a bridge between temperature and energy. This constant is important in many science formulas, like those for black-body radiation and entropy. Named after Ludwig Boltzmann, it's now set to an exact value: 1.380649×10−23 joules per kelvin. This makes it one of the fundamental building blocks in the International System of Units (SI).",
