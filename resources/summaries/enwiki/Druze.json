	"summary": "The Druze are an Arab religious group with a unique faith. They believe in one God, reincarnation, and the soul's eternity. Druze teachings come from the Epistles of Wisdom. This religion started from Isma'ilism, a type of Islam, but they don't consider themselves Muslims. They speak Arabic and live mainly in Lebanon, Syria, and Israel.\n\nDruze keep their practices secret, and only those called \"uqqƒÅl\" know their faith's secrets. They respect figures like Shuaib (Jethro) and consider many religious leaders as prophets. With about 800,000 to 1 million followers, they've been an essential part of the Levant's history and politics.",
