	"summary": "Mesoamerica is a historical region with unique culture, spanning from southern Mexico to Central America. It's where ancient civilizations, like the Olmec and Maya, thrived for over 3,000 years. These societies had complex cities, writing systems, and shared cultural traits. They grew crops like maize and cacao, and played a game using a rubber ball.\n\nThe Spanish arrived in the 1500s, bringing diseases that sadly wiped out most of the indigenous people. Today, some of their descendants still live in the area, keeping parts of their ancient culture alive.",
