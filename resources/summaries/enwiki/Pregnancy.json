	"summary": "Pregnancy is when a baby grows inside a woman's womb, usually after sexual intercourse. It lasts about 9 months (40 weeks). Pregnancy can be confirmed with a test. It's divided into three parts (trimesters), and the first one includes conception, where the egg is fertilized by sperm.\n\nEarly signs include missed periods, breast changes, and nausea. Prenatal care, like healthy eating and medical check-ups, helps ensure a healthy pregnancy. Babies born too early (before 37 weeks) may have health issues. Ideally, labor starts naturally between 39 and 41 weeks.",
