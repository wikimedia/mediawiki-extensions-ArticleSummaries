	"summary": "The Chechen people have a long history of fighting Russian rule, starting with Sheikh Mansur in 1785. After years of resistance, Russia took control of Chechnya in the 19th century. In 1944, over 500,000 Chechens and other North Caucasians were forced to leave their homes and move to Siberia or Central Asia. This was because Russia accused them of helping Germany in World War II, even though many Chechens fought for the Soviets. They were allowed to return in 1957, and their republic was restored.",
