	"summary": "iTunes was a popular software made by Apple to manage music and videos. It let users buy, play, and organize digital media on their computers. Introduced in 2001, it became a go-to tool for Apple's iPod, iPhone, and iPad users. Over time, iTunes expanded to include podcasts, e-books, and apps. However, critics argued it became too complex. \n\nStarting in 2019, Apple split iTunes into separate apps (Music, Podcasts, TV) on newer Macs and Windows 11. This change aimed to simplify the user experience, but iTunes still exists for older systems and handles podcasts and audiobooks.",
