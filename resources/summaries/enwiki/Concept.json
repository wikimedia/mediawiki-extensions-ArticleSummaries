	"summary": "A concept is an abstract idea that forms the basis for our thoughts and beliefs. It's like a building block for our thinking. Concepts are important in many fields of study, such as linguistics, psychology, and philosophy, which explore how we understand and use these ideas. They can be organized in a hierarchy, with some concepts being more general (like \"furniture\") and others more specific (like \"chair\"). Concepts can also be exact or generalizations, helping us simplify and understand the world around us.",
