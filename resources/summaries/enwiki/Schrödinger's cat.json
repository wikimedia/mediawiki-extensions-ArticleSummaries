	"summary": "## Schrödinger's Cat Simplified\n\nErwin Schrödinger created a thought experiment to show a weird part of quantum mechanics. He imagined a cat, poison, and a radioactive source in a box. According to quantum rules, until someone looks, the cat is both alive and dead at the same time! This is called a superposition.\n\nSchrödinger's cat helps scientists understand how tiny things like atoms can be in multiple states at once. But it's important to remember, this experiment is just a way to explain things, not a real test on a real cat.",
