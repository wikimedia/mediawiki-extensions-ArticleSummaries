	"summary": "The North Pole, also called the Geographic North Pole, is where Earth's axis meets the surface in the Northern Hemisphere. It's at 90Â° North latitude and all directions point south. The nearest land is Kaffeklubben Island, Greenland.\n\nThe North Pole is in the Arctic Ocean, covered with shifting sea ice. It's hard to build a permanent station there. The first confirmed expedition to reach the North Pole was in 1926 by Roald Amundsen's airship, *Norge*. Later, Soviet and Russian teams reached the Pole on foot and by snowmobile.",
