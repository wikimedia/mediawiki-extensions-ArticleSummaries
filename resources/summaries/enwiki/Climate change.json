	"summary": "The Earth is getting hotter, especially in the Arctic. This is because of human activities like burning fossil fuels, which release special gases that trap heat. This is called the greenhouse effect. As a result, we see more extreme weather, like heatwaves and intense storms.\n\nClimate change affects the environment and people. It causes problems like bigger deserts, rising sea levels, and food and water shortages. It also threatens many animals with extinction. To stop this, we need to reduce the use of fossil fuels and switch to cleaner energy sources.",
