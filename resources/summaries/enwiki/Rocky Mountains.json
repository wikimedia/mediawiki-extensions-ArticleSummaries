	"summary": "The Rocky Mountains, or the Rockies, are a massive mountain range in North America, stretching over 3,000 miles from Canada to New Mexico. They formed around 55-80 million years ago when tectonic plates shifted underneath the North American Plate, creating a mountain belt. The Rockies are known for their dramatic peaks and valleys, shaped by further tectonic activity and glaciers.\n\nHumans have inhabited the area since the last ice age, and European explorers like Sir Alexander Mackenzie and the Lewis and Clark Expedition documented its natural resources. Today, the Rockies are popular for outdoor activities and offer stunning landscapes in protected parks and forests.",
