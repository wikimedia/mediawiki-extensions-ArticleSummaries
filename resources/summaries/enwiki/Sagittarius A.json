Sgr A* is located near the constellations Sagittarius and Scorpius. Scientists have studied stars orbiting it, like S2, to find its mass and size. With over 4 million times the Sun's mass, it's considered the Milky Way's central black hole. In 2022, astronomers captured the first image of its accretion disk, confirming its nature as a black hole.",
