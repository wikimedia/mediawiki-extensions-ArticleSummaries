	"summary": "Vampires are mythical creatures that drink blood to survive. In old European stories, they were dead people who caused trouble. They looked different from the vampires we know today, being fat and red or dark in color. People in many countries have vampire-like legends.\n\nThe word \"vampire\" became popular in Europe after people went crazy over vampire stories in the 1800s. A famous book, *Dracula*, written in 1897, made vampires super popular. Now, vampires are huge in books, movies, and games, but most people know they aren't real.",
