	"summary": "Denisovans are an extinct group of humans who lived in Asia over 25,000 years ago. We mostly know about them from DNA found in fossils like a finger bone in Siberia. They were related to Neanderthals and had dark skin, eyes, and hair. Denisovans mixed with modern humans, especially in Melanesia, Australia, and the Philippines. They also interbred with Neanderthals and another unknown ancient human species.",
