	"summary": "The Aztec Empire was a powerful alliance between three city-states: Tenochtitlan, Tetzcoco, and Tlacopan. It began in 1428 and ruled central Mexico until the Spanish, led by Hernán Cortés, conquered them in 1521. Tenochtitlan became the dominant city, controlling the other partners. The empire expanded through wars, ruling over central Mexico and some distant lands.\n\nAztec religion was complex, with many gods. They believed in a supreme god, Ometeotl, and had a special worship for Huītzilōpōchtli, their war god. They allowed conquered people to keep their beliefs but added Huītzilōpōchtli to their rituals.",
