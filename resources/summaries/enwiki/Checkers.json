	"summary": "Checkers, or draughts, is a two-player board game where pieces move forward and capture opponents by jumping. It originated from a game called alquerque. The name comes from the checkered board it's played on. There are different versions, like American checkers (8x8 board) and International draughts (10x10 board). Some variants use larger boards.\n\nAmerican checkers was solved by computer scientists in 2007, showing that perfect play from both players always ends in a tie.",
