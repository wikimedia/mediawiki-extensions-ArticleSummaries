	"summary": "Boron is a chemical element with the symbol B. It's a brittle, dark, shiny metalloid when crystalline, but a brown powder in its amorphous form. Boron has three valence electrons, forming many compounds like boric acid and sodium borate. It's rare in the Solar System and Earth's crust, found mostly in borate minerals like borax.\n\nElemental boron is hard, poor at conducting electricity, and mostly produced for industrial use. It's added to fiberglass for insulation and used in high-strength materials. Boron compounds are also in polymers, ceramics, and glass. A small amount is used in electronics and medicine. Boron is essential for plants but has limited biological use in mammals.",
