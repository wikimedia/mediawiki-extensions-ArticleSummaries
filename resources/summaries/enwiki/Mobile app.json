Apps help with various tasks, like email, games, and location services. There are millions of apps available, and many need an internet connection. You can download them from app stores.\n\nThe term \"app\" is short for \"application.\" There are three main types: native (made for specific operating systems like iOS or Android), web apps (written in HTML5 and run in browsers), and hybrid apps (use web technologies but look like native apps).",
