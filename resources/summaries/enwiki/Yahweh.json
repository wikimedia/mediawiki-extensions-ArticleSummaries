	"summary": "The God on the Winged Wheel coin is an ancient silver coin from around 400 BCE, possibly showing the god Yahweh on a winged wheel. Yahweh was an important deity in ancient Israel, originally part of a polytheistic religion. Over time, Yahweh became the only god worshipped, evolving into the concept of God in Judaism. The name Yahweh was eventually considered too sacred to speak aloud, and people started using the term \"adonai\" instead. Today, the original pronunciation of Yahweh is unknown.",
