	"summary": "Nematodes, also known as roundworms, are a diverse group of animals found almost everywhere on Earth. They live in soil, water, and even inside other animals as parasites. These worms are important in ecosystems, helping to break down materials and affecting food chains.\n\nThere are likely over 25,000 known species, with estimates suggesting there could be up to 1 million different types. They are tiny, often hard to tell apart, and can live in extreme environments, from deep underground to the coldest polar regions. Some nematodes cause diseases in plants and animals, including humans.",
