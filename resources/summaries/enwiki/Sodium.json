	"summary": "Sodium (symbol Na) is a soft, silvery-white metal. It's found in nature in compounds like salt (NaCl) and is very reactive. Sodium is essential for animals and some plants. In our bodies, it helps nerves send signals and keeps the right amount of water around cells. \n\nIt's the sixth most common element in Earth's crust and is often found in minerals. Sodium compounds are often soluble in water, which is why seawater contains a lot of sodium.",
