	"summary": "Same-sex marriage is when two people of the same gender get married. As of 2024, 36 countries allow and recognize these marriages, with more planning to do so. Many developed countries support it, but some, like Italy and Japan, do not. Same-sex marriage has a long history, but the first legal one happened in 1971. The Netherlands was the first country to legalize it in 2001.\n\nScientific studies show that same-sex marriage benefits gay people and their children. It also doesn't harm heterosexual marriages. However, some people oppose it due to religious beliefs or the idea that it's unnatural. But studies prove that homosexuality is natural and not a choice.",
