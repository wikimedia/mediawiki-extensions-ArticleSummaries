	"summary": "Emus are tall, flightless birds found in Australia. They have brown feathers, long necks, and can run very fast. These omnivores eat plants and insects and can go without food for weeks.\n\nDuring breeding season, females fight for mates, and males incubate the eggs. Emus are common in Australia, but some local populations are at risk due to animal predation, road accidents, and habitat loss. Emus are an important part of Australian culture and history, appearing in Indigenous myths and on the country's coat of arms.",
