	"summary": "Transistors are tiny devices that make electronics work. They can make signals louder or switch things on and off. Imagine them as tiny switches or volume knobs. \n\nBack in 1947, scientists at Bell Labs invented the first one, and it was a big deal! Since then, they've gotten even smaller and better. We use them in almost everything, like phones, computers, and radios. They're usually made of silicon and come in different types, like MOSFETs and bipolar transistors.",
