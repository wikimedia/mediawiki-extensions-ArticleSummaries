	"summary": "A bachelor's degree is an undergraduate qualification that takes 3-6 years to complete. Common types are Bachelor of Arts (BA) and Bachelor of Science (BS). It's usually the first step towards further studies like master's or doctorate degrees. \n\nThe term 'bachelor' originally referred to young or poor knights. Over time, it became associated with academic success, like being awarded 'laurel berries' (bacca lauri) for achievements. \n\nSome countries offer 'bachelor with honours' degrees, which require extra study and research, and can be done consecutively after a regular bachelor's degree.",
