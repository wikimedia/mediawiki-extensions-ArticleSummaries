	"summary": "The Saturn V was a powerful rocket built by NASA to send astronauts to the Moon. It was huge and could carry very heavy loads into space. This three-stage rocket used liquid fuel and was designed to be safe for humans to travel in. From 1967 to 1973, it completed nine successful Moon missions and launched the Skylab space station.\n\nNo other rocket has taken people so far from Earth. It could carry over 311,000 pounds into low Earth orbit, including the fuel needed for Moon missions. Wernher von Braun led the design team, and many companies helped build it.",
