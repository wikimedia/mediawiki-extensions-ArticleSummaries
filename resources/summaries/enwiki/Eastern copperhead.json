	"summary": "## Eastern Copperhead Snakes\n\nEastern copperheads are venomous snakes found in eastern North America. They have dark brown, hourglass-shaped markings on a light brown or gray body. These snakes live in forests, swamps, and rocky areas. They hunt by ambushing prey like insects and small animals.\n\nCopperheads are often still when threatened, relying on their camouflage. This can lead to accidental bites if people step on them. While their bites are painful, they rarely cause serious health problems.",
