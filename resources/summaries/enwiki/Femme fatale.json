	"summary": "A **femme fatale** is a mysterious and seductive woman in stories who uses her beauty and charm to trap and sometimes even kill her lovers. The term means \"deadly woman\" in French. These characters are often villains or morally gray, and they can make people feel uneasy. They might use lies, coercion, or even weapons to achieve their goals. The concept was popular in 1930s crime stories and early 20th-century films, where they were sometimes called \"vamps.\" You can find them in modern movies too, like the James Bond series.",
