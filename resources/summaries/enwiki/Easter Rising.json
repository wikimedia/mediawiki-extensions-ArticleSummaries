	"summary": "The Easter Rising was a rebellion in Ireland against British rule in 1916. Irish republicans wanted independence while the UK was busy with World War I. Led by Patrick Pearse and James Connolly, they took over important buildings in Dublin and declared an Irish Republic. The British Army quickly responded, bringing in more soldiers and weapons. The fighting lasted six days, with many civilians caught in the crossfire.\n\nAlthough the Rising was suppressed, it gained support for Irish independence. Many leaders were executed, which angered people and led to political changes. The Sinn FÃ©in party won the 1918 election, taking Ireland towards independence.",
