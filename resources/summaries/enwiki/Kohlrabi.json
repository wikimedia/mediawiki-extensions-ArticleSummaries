	"summary": "Kohlrabi is a vegetable that looks like a turnip but is actually a type of cabbage. It's a special variety of the same plant that gives us cabbage, broccoli, and cauliflower. You can eat it raw or cook it, using both the round, swollen stem and the leaves. Even though it's often called \"German turnip,\" it's not related to regular turnips. It's a healthy and versatile veggie that can be prepared in many ways.",
