It flew to many countries and was like America's flag carrier without being owned by the government. But in the 1970s, things got tough, and it faced competition from other airlines. Pan Am tried to change but eventually went out of business. Even today, people remember Pan Am for its cool uniforms, fancy planes, and how it made traveling the world seem special.",
