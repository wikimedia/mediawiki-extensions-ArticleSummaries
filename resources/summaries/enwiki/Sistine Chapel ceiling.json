Pope Julius II asked Michelangelo to paint it. The ceiling shows stories from the Bible's Book of Genesis, like The Creation of Adam. It also has many figures, both clothed and nude, showing Michelangelo's talent for drawing people. The ceiling is part of a bigger decoration plan that includes wall paintings by other artists like Botticelli and Raphael's tapestries. It's been restored many times and is still very popular today.",
