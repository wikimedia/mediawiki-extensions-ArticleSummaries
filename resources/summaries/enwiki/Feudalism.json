	"summary": "Feudalism was a way of life in medieval Europe, lasting from the 9th to 15th centuries. It was a system where people, especially nobles, had certain duties and obligations to each other and to the land they owned. Lords gave land (fiefs) to vassals in exchange for their loyalty and military service. Peasants, clergy, and nobles were all part of this society, which was often centered around castles. The term 'feudalism' was not used during that time, and some historians debate its use to describe medieval life.",
