	"summary": "The Poincaré Conjecture is a math problem about shapes in four-dimensional space. Henri Poincaré thought up the idea in 1904. It asks if a certain type of space, which looks like our regular 3D space but is finite, is actually a 3D sphere. Many mathematicians worked on this problem, with Grigori Perelman finally proving it in the early 2000s. His proof was considered a big achievement in math. Perelman was offered a $1 million prize for his work, but he refused it, saying another mathematician, Richard Hamilton, deserved credit too.",
