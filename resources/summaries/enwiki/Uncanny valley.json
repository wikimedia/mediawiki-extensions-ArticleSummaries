	"summary": "The \"uncanny valley\" is a theory about how people react to things that look almost human, like robots, 3D animations, or lifelike dolls. If something looks very similar to a human but isn't quite right, it can make people feel uneasy or scared. This effect is strongest when the object moves. The idea is that the more human-like something appears, the more creepy it might seem if it's not perfectly human. This concept is important in robotics and computer graphics to make sure people feel comfortable around these technologies.",
