	"summary": "Epistemology is a fascinating area of philosophy that digs into what we know and how we know it. It looks at different kinds of knowledge, like knowing facts, skills, and familiar experiences. Philosophers in this field study ideas like truth, belief, and why we believe something to understand knowledge better. They explore where our ideas come from, such as our senses, memories, and reasoning.\n\nThere are various thoughts on knowledge; some question if we can truly know anything, while others debate if knowledge is absolute or if it comes from our experiences. Epistemology also branches out to study knowledge in science, math, and even morals, and it's linked to psychology and other fields that explore how we think and learn.",
