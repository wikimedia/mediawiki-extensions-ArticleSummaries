	"summary": "Neo-Nazism is a dangerous movement that tries to bring back the ideas of the Nazi party from World War II. Neo-Nazis believe in white supremacy, hate minorities, and want to create a new fascist government. They copy Nazi beliefs, like racism and antisemitism, and often deny the Holocaust happened. These groups exist worldwide and use symbols like the swastika to show their support for Hitler and the Nazis. Many countries have laws against this kind of hate speech and symbols to stop neo-Nazi activities.",
