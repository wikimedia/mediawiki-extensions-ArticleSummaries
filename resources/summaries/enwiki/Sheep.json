Domestic sheep, scientifically named *Ovis aries*, are descended from wild mouflons. People farm sheep for their wool, meat (lamb or mutton), and milk. There are different names for sheep based on their gender and age, like ewe, ram, and lamb.\n\nSheep have been important in agriculture and human culture for thousands of years, especially in countries like Australia and New Zealand. They are often kept in groups called flocks and are a symbol of peaceful, rural life in many stories and traditions.",
