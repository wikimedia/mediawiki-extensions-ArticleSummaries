	"summary": "Tennis is a popular sport where players use a racket to hit a ball over a net. It can be played alone (singles) or with partners (doubles). The goal is to make the ball land in the opponent's court so they can't return it. Tennis is for everyone, from kids to adults, and even people in wheelchairs can play. It originated in France centuries ago and later developed into the modern game in England. The rules have mostly stayed the same since the 1890s, with a few changes like the tiebreak. Tennis is enjoyed by many and is a big part of the Olympics.",
