	"summary": "Fentanyl is a powerful pain-relieving drug, much stronger than heroin or morphine. It's used to help cancer patients and people in severe pain. But it can be very dangerous, as it can cause breathing to slow down or stop, leading to overdose. Even a small amount can be fatal. Fentanyl is often mixed with other drugs like cocaine and heroin, making overdoses even more likely. It's been a major cause of drug overdose deaths in the U.S. since 2018.",
