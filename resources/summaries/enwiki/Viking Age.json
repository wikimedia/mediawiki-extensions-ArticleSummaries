	"summary": "The Viking Age lasted from around 800 to 1050 CE. Vikings from Scandinavia (Denmark, Norway, Sweden) raided, traded, and settled in many places across Europe and even reached North America. They founded new kingdoms and mixed with local people, creating new cultures like the Normans in France. Reasons for their expansion include wealth, lack of resources at home, and political troubles. We learn about Vikings from writings by those they met, archaeology, and old stories.",
