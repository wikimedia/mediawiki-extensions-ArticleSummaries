This cat is adapted to cold, dry climates and lives in rocky grasslands. It eats mainly rodents and lagomorphs. Pallas's cats are good at hiding in rock crevices and burrows. They have 2-6 kittens in the spring.\n\nAlthough they are widespread, some populations are at risk due to poaching and habitat loss. Many zoos worldwide have Pallas's cats in breeding programs to help protect the species.",
