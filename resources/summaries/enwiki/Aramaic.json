Today, some people still speak modern Aramaic in Syria and other regions. It is also used in churches and Jewish, Samaritan, and Mandaean religious practices.\n\nAramaic is related to languages like Hebrew and Phoenician. Its alphabet, derived from the Phoenician one, influenced the creation of the Hebrew and Arabic alphabets. Unfortunately, many Aramaic dialects are now endangered, with efforts to document them before they disappear.",
