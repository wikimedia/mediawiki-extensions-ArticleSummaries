It uses a system called \"torrents\" to connect people who want files with those who have them.\n\nTPB has faced legal trouble and been blocked in some countries because it allows people to share copyrighted material without permission. Its creators were even sent to prison for a short time. Despite this, TPB remains popular and has become a symbol of the debate over file sharing and copyright laws.",
