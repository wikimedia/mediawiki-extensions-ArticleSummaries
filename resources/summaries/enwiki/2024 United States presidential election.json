	"summary": "The 2024 US presidential election will be held on November 5, 2024, with voters choosing electors who will decide the president and vice president. Incumbent President Joe Biden initially sought re-election but later withdrew due to concerns about his health and age, endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris, who became the Democratic nominee. Harris' running mate is Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota. Biden's withdrawal is notable as he is the first eligible incumbent president since 1968 to not seek re-election. His predecessor, Donald Trump, is running for a second term, aiming for a non-consecutive victory after losing to Biden in 2020. The Republican nominee, Trump, has made controversial statements and promoted conspiracy theories, including false claims about the 2020 election. This election will also decide representatives for the US Senate, House, and state governments, with key swing states including Arizona, Georgia, and Michigan. Leading campaign issues include abortion, immigration, climate change, and healthcare.",
