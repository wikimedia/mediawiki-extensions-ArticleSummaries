	"summary": "Esperanto is a unique language created by L. L. Zamenhof in 1887. Its goal is to be a global second language for everyone. It's a mix of different European languages, mostly Romance languages, but also Germanic, Greek, and Slavic. One cool feature is its word-building system, where you can create new words by adding prefixes and suffixes.\n\nAlthough not an official language of any country, Esperanto is spoken worldwide, especially in Europe, East Asia, and South America. It has a community of native speakers and many more who can speak it. People who use Esperanto are known as Esperantists.",
