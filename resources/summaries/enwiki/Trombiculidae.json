	"summary": "Trombiculidae, or chiggers, are tiny mites that live in forests and grasslands. In their larval stage, they bite animals and humans, causing intense itching and skin irritation. These mites are often mistaken for fleas. They are microscopic, with a bright orange color, and mainly active in early summer. Chiggers inject digestive enzymes into the skin, creating a small hole called a stylostome, which leads to itching and red bumps. After feeding, they drop off and become nymphs, then adults, which are harmless and feed on plants.",
