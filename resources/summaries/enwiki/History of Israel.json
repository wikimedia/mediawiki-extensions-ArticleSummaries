	"summary": "Israel's history begins in the Southern Levant, also known as Canaan or the Holy Land. Early humans migrated here from Africa, leading to the development of ancient civilizations like the Canaanites and later, the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. The region was ruled by many empires, including the Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, and Romans.\n\nIn the 7th century, Islam spread, and the Muslim conquest brought new rule. The Crusades in the 12th and 13th centuries led to battles between Christian and Muslim armies. Later, the Ottoman Empire controlled the region until the 20th century.\n\nJewish immigration increased with the rise of Zionism. After World War I, the British ruled the area, promising a Jewish homeland. This led to tensions with Palestinian Arabs. In 1948, Israel declared independence, winning a war against neighboring countries and leading to Jewish migration from the Middle East.",
