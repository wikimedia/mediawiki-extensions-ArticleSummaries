	"summary": "A penis is a male body part used for reproduction. It helps to put sperm inside a female animal during mating. Not all male animals have a penis; some have different structures. For example, male octopuses use a special arm called a hectocotylus, and male spiders use pedipalps. Even among vertebrates (animals with backbones), there are different types of penises, like the hemipenes. The word \"penis\" is used for many of these organs, but not all.",
