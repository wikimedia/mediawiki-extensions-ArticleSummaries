	"summary": "Shabbat, or the Jewish Sabbath, is a special day of rest on Saturday. It starts on Friday evening and ends on Saturday night. Jews believe it honors God's creation and freedom from slavery. During Shabbat, people don't work but instead enjoy peaceful activities with family. They light candles, bless wine and bread, and have three special meals. It's a time to relax, think about life's spiritual side, and look forward to a better future. The day ends with a ceremony called Havdalah, marking the transition back to the regular week.",
