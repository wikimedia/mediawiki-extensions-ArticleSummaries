They rose to fame in the 1990s with their debut album, \"Definitely Maybe,\" and its follow-up, \"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?,\" which became massive successes and propelled them to international stardom. Oasis's music and public image heavily influenced the Britpop genre, and their songs topped the charts in the UK and worldwide. Despite member changes and the Gallagher brothers' notorious disputes, Oasis released several more albums and continued to perform until their disbandment in 2009. With over 75 million records sold, they remain one of the best-selling bands of all time and have won numerous awards for their music. In 2024, Oasis announced their reform for a world tour starting in 2025.",
