	"summary": "Veganism is a way of life where people choose not to use or eat anything that comes from animals. This includes food like meat, eggs, and dairy, as well as clothes made from leather or wool. Vegans believe in treating animals with respect and not using them as products. They often do this to stay healthy, help the environment, and stop animal cruelty. Instead, they eat lots of fruits, veggies, beans, and grains. The word \"vegan\" was created in 1944, but people have been avoiding animal products for a very long time.",
