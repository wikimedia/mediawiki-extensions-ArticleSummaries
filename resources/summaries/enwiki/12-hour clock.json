	"summary": "The 12-hour clock divides the day into two parts: a.m. (before noon) and p.m. (after noon). Each part has 12 hours numbered from 1 to 12, with 12 representing midnight or noon. This system has been used since ancient times and is common in many English-speaking countries. However, there's no universal agreement on how to mark midnight and noon; \"12 a.m.\" usually means midnight, while \"12 p.m.\" is noon.",
