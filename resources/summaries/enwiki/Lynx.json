	"summary": "Lynx are medium-sized wild cats with four living species: Canada lynx, Iberian lynx, Eurasian lynx, and bobcat. The name \"lynx\" comes from ancient Greek, referring to the cat's bright, reflective eyes. These cats are known for their distinctive long fur, pointed ears, and often a tuft of hair on their cheeks. They are skilled hunters, mainly targeting small mammals, birds, and sometimes larger prey. Lynx are typically solitary and territorial animals.",
