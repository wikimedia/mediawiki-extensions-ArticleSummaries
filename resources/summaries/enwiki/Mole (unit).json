	"summary": "## Mole\n\nA mole (symbol: mol) is a unit of measurement used in the International System of Units (SI) to count the number of tiny particles, like atoms or molecules, in a substance. One mole has about 602 sextillion (a huge number!) of these particles. It's like having 602,000,000,000,000,000,000 friends! This number is called Avogadro's number. Moles are super useful in chemistry for measuring how much of a substance is needed or created in a reaction.",
