	"summary": "The Salem witch trials happened in Massachusetts between 1692 and 1693. Over 200 people were accused of witchcraft, and 19 were executed by hanging. The trials were conducted by special courts in Salem. They ended when clergymen questioned the evidence used and many accusers admitted lying. In 1711, the convictions were reversed. This event is a famous example of mass hysteria and has been used as a warning about false accusations and unfair trials. Recently, all the convicted \"witches\" have been officially cleared.",
