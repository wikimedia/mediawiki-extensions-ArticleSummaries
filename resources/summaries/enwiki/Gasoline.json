	"summary": "Gasoline, or petrol, is a flammable liquid made from petroleum, used mainly as fuel for cars. It's refined from crude oil and mixed with additives to improve its performance. The quality of gasoline is measured by its octane rating, which prevents engines from knocking. Lead additives were once used but are now banned due to health risks. Gasoline can harm the environment and contribute to climate change when leaked or burned. It's important to handle and store gasoline safely to avoid these risks.",
