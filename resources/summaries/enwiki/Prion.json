	"summary": "Prions are tiny proteins that can cause big problems. They're like bad seeds that make other proteins go bad too, leading to deadly brain diseases in humans and animals, like \"mad cow disease.\" These diseases can't be cured and are always fatal. Prions are unique because they don't have DNA like other germs. They can spread by copying themselves and forming clumps, like building blocks stacking up in the wrong way. This causes brain cells to die. Scientists are still learning about prions and how to stop them.",
