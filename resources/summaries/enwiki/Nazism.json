	"summary": "Nazism, short for National Socialism, was a harmful political belief in Germany led by Adolf Hitler. It started in the early 20th century and gained power in the 1930s. The Nazis wanted a strong, unified Germany, but their ideas were very dangerous. They believed in racial superiority, especially of ethnic Germans, and hated Jews, communists, and other groups. They used violence and took over the government, becoming a dictatorship. \n\nDuring World War II, the Nazis committed terrible crimes, killing millions, including most European Jews in the Holocaust. After the war, Nazism was seen as evil and is now against the law in many European countries.",
