Historically, women faced gender inequality due to traditional roles and patriarchal societies, but the 20th century saw more opportunities open up. Violence against women and denied reproductive rights remain issues. Feminism aims to achieve equality. It's important to note that transgender and intersex women also exist, challenging typical gender norms.",
