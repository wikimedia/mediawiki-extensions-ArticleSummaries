	"summary": "Poliomyelitis, or polio, is a serious disease caused by a virus. Most people don't show symptoms, but some may experience a sore throat, fever, or even paralysis. It spreads through feces or mouth contact. Polio has a long history, dating back to ancient times, but became a major issue in the late 19th century. Vaccines introduced in the 1950s significantly reduced polio cases. Today, only a few countries still have polio, thanks to vaccines like IPV and OPV. These vaccines prevent the disease, and improved versions are being used to eradicate polio worldwide.",
