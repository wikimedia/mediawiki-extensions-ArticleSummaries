	"summary": "The Erie Canal is a famous canal in New York, connecting the Hudson River and Lake Erie. Built in 1825, it was the first route linking the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes. This 363-mile-long canal made it easier and cheaper to travel and transport goods across the country. It played a big part in growing the economy of New York State and helping people settle in the west. Over time, the canal was made bigger and deeper, and today, it's mostly used for fun activities like boating and cycling along its path.",
