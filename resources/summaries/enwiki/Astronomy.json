	"summary": "Astronomy is the cool science of studying everything in space, like planets, stars, and galaxies. It uses math, physics, and chemistry to understand how these things formed and changed over time. People have been doing astronomy for a very long time; ancient civilizations like the Egyptians and Greeks observed the night sky.\n\nThere are two main types of astronomy: observational (collecting data about space) and theoretical (creating models to explain what's observed). Amateurs also contribute, especially when new things happen in space, like a new comet.",
