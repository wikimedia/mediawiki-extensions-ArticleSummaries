	"summary": "Titanis was a massive bird of prey, related to the \"terror birds\" that lived in South America. Its name comes from Greek mythology, meaning \"Titan.\" This extinct bird lived in the United States during the Pliocene and early Pleistocene epochs. With an estimated height of 4.6 to 6.6 feet (1.4 to 2 meters) and weighing over 660 pounds (300 kilograms), it was one of the largest birds ever. Its long legs and powerful beak made it an apex predator, hunting large mammals like armadillos, horses, and tapirs. Titanis is special because it's the only terror bird known to have lived in North America.",
