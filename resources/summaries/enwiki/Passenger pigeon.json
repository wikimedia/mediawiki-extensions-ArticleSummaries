	"summary": "The passenger pigeon, once North America's most common bird, is now extinct. These gray, fast-flying pigeons lived in huge flocks and ate fruits, nuts, and insects. They were hunted heavily for food after Europeans arrived, and their forest homes were destroyed. The last wild one was shot in 1900, and the last captive pigeon, named Martha, died in 1914. This is a sad example of how humans can cause a species to disappear.",
