	"summary": "The Tasmanian devil is a meat-eating marsupial found only on the island of Tasmania, Australia. Once common on the mainland, it went extinct there thousands of years ago. It's the world's largest carnivorous marsupial, with a stocky build, black fur, and a strong bite. Devils are usually solitary but can be social when eating or defecating. They hunt and scavenge for food, and are active during the day. Females give birth to 20-30 live young, but only a few survive due to limited pouch space. The species is endangered due to a facial tumor disease, but conservation efforts are underway.",
