	"summary": "The Garden of Eden is a special place in the Bible, like a beautiful paradise. It was painted by artists Jan Brueghel and Pieter Paul Rubens, showing many animals like tigers and parrots living together. In the story, God created this garden for the first people, Adam and Eve. It was a perfect place with trees and rivers, located somewhere in the Middle East, maybe in Mesopotamia. The name \"Eden\" comes from a word meaning \"plain\" or \"steppe,\" and it's also linked to a Hebrew word for \"pleasure.\"",
