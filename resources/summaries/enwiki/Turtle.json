	"summary": "Turtles are reptiles with a unique shell made of bone and covered in keratin scales. They're divided into two groups based on how they retract their heads. There are over 350 species, including tortoises and sea turtles, living on land, in freshwater, and in oceans. Turtles breathe air, are cold-blooded, and eat both plants and animals. Many migrate short distances, while sea turtles travel long ones to lay eggs. Turtles are important in culture and as pets, but many species are endangered due to hunting, habitat loss, and getting caught in fishing nets.",
