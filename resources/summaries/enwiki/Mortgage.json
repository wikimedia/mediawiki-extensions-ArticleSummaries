	"summary": "##  Understanding Mortgages\n\nA mortgage is a loan to buy property, secured by the property itself. You pay back the loan with interest over time.\n\nThere are different types of mortgages, but a common one is a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 4% interest on a $250,000 loan. Over 30 years, you'd pay back the full loan amount plus interest.\n\nThe total cost includes the original loan amount, interest, taxes, and fees. Longer loan terms mean smaller monthly payments but more interest paid overall.",
