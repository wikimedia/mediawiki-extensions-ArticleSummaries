These issues might affect your senses, like hearing and smell, or activities like breathing and swallowing. They also deal with cancers and tumors in this region.\n\nENT doctors use various tools and techniques, including lasers, to perform surgeries. For example, a 40-watt CO2 laser is used for delicate procedures in the throat, nose, and ear hospital. This specialty has a long history, with the Royal National Throat, Nose and Ear Hospital in London dating back to 1874.",
