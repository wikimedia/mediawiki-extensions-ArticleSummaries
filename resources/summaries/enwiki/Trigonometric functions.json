	"summary": "## Trigonometry: Unlocking Triangle Secrets\n\nTrigonometry uses special functions (like sine, cosine, and tangent) to study triangles. These functions relate angles to the lengths of triangle sides. They are essential in fields like navigation and physics.\n\nOriginally defined for right triangles, these functions can now be used with any angle thanks to the unit circle and complex numbers.  This makes them incredibly versatile tools for solving problems involving angles and waves.",
