	"summary": "A star is a glowing ball of hot gas, mainly hydrogen and helium, held together by its gravity. Our closest star is the Sun. There are billions of stars in the universe, forming patterns called constellations. Stars are born from collapsing clouds of gas and dust and shine by fusing hydrogen into helium. Their lives end in different ways, leaving behind various remnants. Stars create most of the elements in the universe, and their remains help form new stars and planets. Astronomers study stars to understand their properties and how they move. Stars can also be part of systems with planets or multiple stars.",
