	"summary": "The Tropic of Cancer is an imaginary line on Earth's surface, located at 23.4Â° north of the Equator. On the summer solstice, the Sun is directly above this line, making it the northernmost point where the Sun can be seen directly overhead. It's one of the five important lines, or parallels, on Earth, along with the Equator and the Arctic and Antarctic Circles. These lines change position due to Earth's tilt. Interestingly, in politics, it marks the southern limit of NATO's mutual defense agreement.",
