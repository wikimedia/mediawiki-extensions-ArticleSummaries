	"summary": "The Mamluk Sultanate was a powerful Islamic state that ruled over Egypt, parts of the Middle East, and the Hejaz from the 1200s to the early 1500s. It was led by a military group called the Mamluks, who were originally slave soldiers. They took control from the Ayyubid dynasty in 1250. The Mamluks successfully stopped the Mongol invasion in 1260 and expanded their empire. The sultanate had two main periods: the Turkic/Bahri era (1250-1382) and the Circassian/Burji era (1382-1517). It was eventually conquered by the Ottoman Empire in 1517.",
