	"summary": "The Canada goose is a big bird found in North America and some parts of Europe. It has a black head, white cheeks, and a brown body. These geese usually eat plants and migrate, but they can live in cities and farms too. They are good at adapting to places with people. While they are common in parks, some think they are pests because they make noise, eat crops, and their poop can be a problem. They can also be aggressive when protecting their nests.",
