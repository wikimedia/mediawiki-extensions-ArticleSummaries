	"summary": "Mestizo is a term used to describe people of mixed European and Indigenous ancestry, mainly in the former Spanish Empire. It was a way to classify people based on their race in official records. Over time, the term's meaning has changed. In Latin America, it now often refers to people with a European cultural background, even if they have Indigenous ancestors. The word is less used today, and some countries have adopted new terms to describe mixed-race people. In Mexico, for example, \"mestizo\" was used to unite different races under one Mexican identity.",
