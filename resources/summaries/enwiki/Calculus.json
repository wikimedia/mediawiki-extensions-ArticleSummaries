	"summary": "Calculus is a branch of math that studies how things change. It's like geometry (shapes) and algebra (equations), but focuses on how things move and grow. It has two main parts: differential calculus, which looks at how things change at a single point, and integral calculus, which studies the total amount of something over a period.\n\nDeveloped by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz in the 1600s, calculus is now used in many fields, like science and engineering, to solve real-world problems.",
