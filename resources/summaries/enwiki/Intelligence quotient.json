	"summary": "An Intelligence Quotient (IQ) is a score that measures human intelligence using standardized tests. The term \"IQ\" was introduced by psychologist William Stern in 1912. Originally, IQ was calculated by dividing a person's mental age by their chronological age and multiplying by 100. Today, modern IQ tests give scores based on a normal distribution with an average of 100 and a standard deviation of 15.\n\nIQ scores are used for educational placement, job applications, and research. They can predict job performance and income. However, IQ doesn't measure intelligence precisely, as it's an abstract concept. Scores can be influenced by factors like nutrition, socioeconomic status, and environment.\n\nOver time, IQ scores have been increasing, a phenomenon known as the Flynn effect. This suggests that intelligence, as measured by IQ, can change over generations.",
