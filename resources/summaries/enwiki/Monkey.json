	"summary": "Monkeys are a group of mammals that include most species in the infraorder Simiiformes. Traditionally, apes were not considered monkeys, but in a broader sense, they are included. Monkeys are divided into Old World (Catarrhini) and New World (Platyrrhini) groups. They are often tree-dwelling and active during the day. Old World monkeys and apes are more closely related and share a common ancestor. Monkeys have unique features like two pectoral nipples and a pendulous penis. Lemurs and tarsiers are not monkeys but related primates.",
