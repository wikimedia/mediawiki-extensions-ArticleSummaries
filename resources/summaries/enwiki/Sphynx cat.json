	"summary": "## Sphynx Cats: Furless Felines\n\nSphynx cats are known for having no fur. They naturally have this trait, and breeders have selectively chosen these cats since the 1960s to create the breed. Their skin feels like soft leather and can have different colors and patterns, just like fur would.  They might have whiskers, but sometimes they're missing. Sphynx cats feel warmer than other cats because they lose body heat faster and love cozy spots.",
