They're easily recognized by their black-barred forelegs and short, \"bobbed\" tails. These adaptable predators live in various habitats, from forests to swamps, and hunt rabbits, hares, rodents, and even deer.\n\nDespite past hunting pressure, bobcat populations remain stable. They are considered a species of \"Least Concern\" by scientists.  Two subspecies exist, separated by the Great Plains.",
