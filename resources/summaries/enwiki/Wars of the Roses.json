The wars started because of economic problems and arguments over who had the best claim to the throne. After lots of battles and changes, the Yorks won, but their king, Richard III, was defeated by Henry Tudor in 1485.\n\nHenry Tudor became King Henry VII and married Elizabeth of York, uniting the two families and starting the Tudor dynasty which ruled England for a long time.",
