This tricolor pattern has a long history, dating back to Tsar Peter the Great in the late 17th century. It was used as a civil ensign and later became the national flag under Emperor Nicholas II. After the Soviet era, Russia brought back the tricolor flag, and President Boris Yeltsin finalized its design in 1993.",
