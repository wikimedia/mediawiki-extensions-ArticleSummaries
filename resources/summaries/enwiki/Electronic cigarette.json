	"summary": "E-cigarettes are devices that let users inhale vapor, often with nicotine and flavorings. They look like real cigarettes but have a battery and a part that holds liquid. When you puff, the battery heats the liquid, creating a vapor.\n\nThere are many types, from ones that look like cigarettes to larger devices. Some are disposable, and others can be recharged. While vaping is likely less harmful than smoking, it's still not safe. Nicotine is addictive, and scientists are still learning about the long-term effects of e-cigarettes.",
