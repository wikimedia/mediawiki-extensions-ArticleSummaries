Despite their size, they eat and live like other brown bears, mostly hunting and scavenging.\n\nPeople have hunted Kodiak bears for sport and protection for centuries. While they're not considered endangered, conservation efforts are important as more people move into their habitat. Scientists keep a close eye on Kodiak bear populations to make sure they stay healthy.",
