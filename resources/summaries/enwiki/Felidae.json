	"summary": "Felidae is the family of mammals known as cats. There are 41 different types of cats, each with unique fur patterns. They have sharp claws, strong muscles, and powerful bites. Cats are meat-eaters and often hunt alone. They live in various places, from forests to deserts.\n\nScientists group cats into two main groups: Pantherinae and Felinae. These groups are based on their bones and how they developed over time. The earliest cats appeared around 25 million years ago. Some ancient cats had long, sharp teeth, like the saber-toothed tigers.",
