	"summary": "Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is a common food additive used to enhance flavor. It's a type of salt made from glutamic acid, which is naturally found in tomatoes and cheese. MSG gives food a savory taste, similar to the flavor in stews and meat soups.\n\nFirst created in 1908 by a Japanese scientist, MSG is now used in many cuisines, especially Asian dishes. It's often added to stock cubes, soups, and snacks. Despite some beliefs, scientific studies show that MSG is generally safe and doesn't usually cause side effects like headaches when consumed in normal amounts.",
