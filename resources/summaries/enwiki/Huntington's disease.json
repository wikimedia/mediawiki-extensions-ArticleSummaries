	"summary": "Huntington's disease is a serious brain disorder passed down in families. Early signs include mood changes and trouble thinking or moving. As it progresses, people may have jerky movements, lose balance, and struggle to speak. It often starts around age 40, but some get it earlier.\n\nThe cause is a faulty gene, HTT, which makes a harmful protein. This gene is dominant, meaning only one copy from a parent can cause the disease. There's no cure, but medicine can help with some symptoms. HD affects about 1 in 10,000 people and is more common in people of European descent.",
