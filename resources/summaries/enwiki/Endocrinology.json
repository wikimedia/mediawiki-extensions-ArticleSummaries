	"summary": "Endocrinology is a science that studies hormones and the endocrine system. Hormones are special chemicals produced by glands in our bodies. These glands, like the thyroid or pancreas, release hormones directly into our blood. Hormones control many important functions, such as growth, mood, and how our body uses energy. They can affect different parts of the body, like the brain, heart, or bones. Endocrinologists are doctors who specialize in understanding and treating problems related to hormones and glands.",
