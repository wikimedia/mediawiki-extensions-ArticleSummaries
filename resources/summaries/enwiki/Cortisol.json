	"summary": "Cortisol is a natural hormone that helps our bodies deal with stress. It's made in a part of the adrenal glands called the zona fasciculata. When we're stressed or our blood sugar is low, cortisol levels go up. This hormone boosts blood sugar, calms the immune system, and helps us use energy. It also affects how our body builds bones. These actions happen when cortisol attaches to special receptors inside cells and then changes how our genes work.",
