	"summary": "World Championship Wrestling (WCW) was an American wrestling company started by Ted Turner in 1988. It became one of the biggest wrestling promotions in the U.S., competing with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). Under Eric Bischoff's leadership, WCW got popular with real-life storylines and hiring WWF stars. They also created a fun, fast-paced wrestling style called the cruiserweight division. WCW's TV show, Monday Nitro, beat the WWF's show in ratings for a while. But in the late 1990s, WCW lost viewers and money, and was eventually bought by the WWF in 2001.",
