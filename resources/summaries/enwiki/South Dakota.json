	"summary": "South Dakota is a state in the central United States, named after the Dakota Sioux tribe. It's the 17th largest state by area but has a small population. The Missouri River divides it into two distinct regions: \"East River\" and \"West River.\" Pierre is the capital, and Sioux Falls is the biggest city.\n\nEuropean settlers arrived in the 19th century, leading to conflicts with the Native Americans, including the Wounded Knee Massacre. South Dakota became a state in 1889. Today, the east has most of the population and fertile farmland, while the west is known for ranching, tourism, and the Black Hills, home to Mount Rushmore.",
