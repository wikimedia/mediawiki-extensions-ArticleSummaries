They can take different forms, like snakes or humans, and can even have children with humans. If someone hurts a jinn, it might seek revenge. Jinn usually live separately in their own tribes. People sometimes use charms with jinn images for protection or magic. Many Muslims believe wearing amulets with God's name protects them from jinn. Some Islamic scholars consider jinn linked to idolatry.",
