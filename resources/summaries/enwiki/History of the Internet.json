	"summary": "The Internet started with scientists wanting to connect computers. In the 1960s, ideas for sharing data between computers were developed, leading to the ARPANET project. This network used \"packet switching,\" allowing data to travel in small groups.\n\nOver time, more networks joined, creating a \"network of networks.\" The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP) were created, forming the Internet we know today. The World Wide Web, invented in the 1980s, made it possible to share information easily.\n\nThe Internet grew quickly, changing how we communicate and access information. It now connects people and devices worldwide, with super-fast speeds and lots of data.",
