	"summary": "The vulva is the external part of a female's genitalia, which includes several structures like the labia, clitoris, and vaginal opening. It's protected by folds of skin and muscles. Blood and nerves supply it, helping with sexual arousal. The vulva changes throughout life stages and varies in appearance, especially the labia minora. It can face disorders like infections, but surgeries and health measures can help. Culturally, views differ; some ancient societies revered it, while others, like Western cultures, have historically had negative attitudes. The term \"vulva\" is often confused with \"vagina,\" which is a separate internal organ.",
