	"summary": "## The Faroe Islands: A Quick Look\n\nThe Faroe Islands are a group of islands in the North Atlantic Ocean, belonging to Denmark but with their own local government. They have a tough climate, with strong winds and not much sunshine. People have lived there since the 9th century, first Norwegians and Norse-Gaels, then later under Norwegian and Danish rule. Today, they have their own language, Faroese, and are mostly self-governing, making their own decisions about many things, including trade and some foreign affairs.",
