	"summary": "**Elden Ring: A Summary**\n\nElden Ring is a 2022 action role-playing game made by FromSoftware. Directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki and with worldbuilding by George R. R. Martin, it's set in the Lands Between. Players go on a mission to fix the Elden Ring and become the new Elden Lord. The game is open-world, with six main areas to explore on horseback. Players can use various weapons and magic, and there's a multiplayer mode.\n\nMiyazaki wanted a more accessible story compared to their earlier games. Martin designed the backstory, and Miyazaki wrote the in-game narrative. Elden Ring won many \"Game of the Year\" awards and is super popular, with over 25 million copies sold. It's praised for its world, gameplay, and story, but some people criticize its technical performance. A DLC called Shadow of the Erdtree was released later, also getting great reviews.",
