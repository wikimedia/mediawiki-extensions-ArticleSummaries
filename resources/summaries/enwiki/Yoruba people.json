	"summary": "The Yoruba are a large ethnic group from West Africa, mainly in Nigeria, Benin, and Togo. They have a rich history and culture, with over 50 million people worldwide. Most Yoruba speak the Yoruba language, which is widely used. They live near other groups like the Itsekiri, Bariba, and Nupe. Many Yoruba were sadly taken as slaves to the Americas, especially Cuba and Brazil, between the 16th and 19th centuries. Today, you can also find Yoruba communities in countries like Ghana, Ivory Coast, and even in the UK and the USA due to migration.",
