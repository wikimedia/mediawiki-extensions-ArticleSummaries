	"summary": "Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of your blood vessels. It's measured in two numbers: systolic (when your heart beats) and diastolic (when your heart rests). A normal reading is around 120/80 mmHg.\n\nDoctors use a tool called a sphygmomanometer to measure it. They might use a stethoscope to listen to your pulse or a digital machine that senses blood flow.\n\nHigh blood pressure, or hypertension, can cause serious problems like strokes and heart disease. Low blood pressure, or hypotension, can also be an issue.",
