	"summary": "The Japanese yen is a major world currency, used for trading and as a reserve currency. Introduced in 1871, it was worth 1.5 grams of gold. After World War II, it was fixed at ¥360 per US dollar. In 1971, the yen started to float, reaching a peak of ¥80 per dollar in 1995. Since then, its value has dropped, with recent years seeing a significant decline, causing concerns. This has also made Japan an attractive travel destination due to the yen's buying power.",
