It's been an Olympic event since 1896 for men and 1964 for women.\n\nAthletes use starting blocks to get a powerful start. The current men's world record is 43.03 seconds, held by Wayde van Niekerk. For women, Marita Koch's record is 47.60 seconds.\n\nSome runners, like Michael Johnson and Marie-José Pérec, have won both the 200m and 400m Olympic titles, a rare achievement.",
