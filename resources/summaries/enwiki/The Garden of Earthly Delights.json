	"summary": "\"The Garden of Earthly Delights\" is a large, three-part painting (called a triptych) by the artist Hieronymus Bosch. It was made between 1490 and 1510 and is now in the Museo del Prado in Madrid. The painting shows Bosch's religious beliefs and can be interpreted in different ways. Some think it warns against worldly pleasures, while others see it as a depiction of a lost paradise. Each panel tells a part of the story, with the left and right panels showing the beginning and end of the world, and the middle panel being the main focus. Bosch painted this work for a private patron, not for a church.",
