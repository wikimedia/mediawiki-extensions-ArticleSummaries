	"summary": "The thylacine, or Tasmanian tiger, was a unique marsupial predator. It lived in Australia, Tasmania, and New Guinea but went extinct around 3,000 years ago on the mainland, possibly due to dingoes. In Tasmania, farmers hunted them for attacking livestock, leading to their extinction in 1936.\n\nThis animal had stripes like a tiger and looked like a wolf. It had a pouch, like other marsupials, used for raising young. Thylacines were skilled hunters, targeting small to medium prey. They are now an iconic symbol of Tasmania, appearing on its coat of arms. Scientists are even trying to clone them!",
