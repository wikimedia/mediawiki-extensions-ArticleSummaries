	"summary": "Surrealism is an art movement that started in Europe after World War I. Artists wanted to show their dreams and unconscious thoughts, creating strange and unexpected pictures. The goal was to mix dreams and reality into a new kind of reality, called \"surreality.\"\n\nThis movement included painting, writing, and movies. It was led by Andr√© Breton, who believed it was a revolutionary way of thinking. Surrealism was also linked to political ideas like communism. It began in 1917 and became official in 1924 with Breton's manifesto. Paris was its main center, and it soon spread worldwide, affecting many kinds of art and even politics.",
