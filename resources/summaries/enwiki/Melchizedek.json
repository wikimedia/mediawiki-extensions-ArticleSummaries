	"summary": "Melchizedek was a king and priest mentioned in the Hebrew Bible. He ruled over Salem and served the \"most high God.\" In Genesis, he welcomes Abram, offering bread, wine, and a blessing. Christians believe Jesus is similar to Melchizedek, a high priest forever. Some scholars think the story was added later to support the priesthood of the Second Temple. The name Melchizedek might also be linked to an ancient Canaanite god.",
