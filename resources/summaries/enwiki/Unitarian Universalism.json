	"summary": "Unitarian Universalism (UU) is a religious movement where people freely explore different beliefs. It started from Protestant and Christian ideas but now includes many faiths. UUs don't follow a single book or belief; instead, they value learning and respect for all religions. They welcome atheists, theists, and more, focusing on growth and community. The main group, UUA, is based in the US, with churches worldwide. It was formed in 1961 by joining two older organizations.",
