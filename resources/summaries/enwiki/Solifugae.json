	"summary": "Solifugae, often called sun spiders or camel spiders, are a group of arachnids with over 1,000 species. They live in dry areas and eat small animals and arthropods. These creatures are not scorpions or spiders, despite their nicknames. Solifuges are typically small, but some can grow up to 6 inches long, including their legs. Don't worry, they are not dangerous to humans, and many stories about their size and speed are not true.",
