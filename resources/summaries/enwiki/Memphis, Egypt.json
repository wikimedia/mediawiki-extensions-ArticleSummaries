This bustling city sat at the Nile Delta's mouth, with a port full of workshops and warehouses. Memphis was a center for trade and religion, protected by the god Ptah. Its great temple, Hut-ka-Ptah, may have given Egypt its name. Over time, Memphis lost its importance as Alexandria rose, and later, Cairo became the focus. Now, its ruins are a tourist attraction, offering a glimpse into Egypt's ancient past.",
