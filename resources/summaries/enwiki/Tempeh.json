	"summary": "Tempeh is a traditional Indonesian food made from fermented soybeans. It's created using a special fungus that turns soybeans into a cake-like shape. This process gives tempeh a higher amount of protein, fiber, and vitamins compared to tofu. Tempeh is firm and has a unique, earthy taste that gets stronger over time. It's very popular in Java, Indonesia, where people eat it as a main protein source.",
