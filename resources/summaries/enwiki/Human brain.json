	"summary": "The brain is the main organ of the human nervous system, controlling most body activities. It's made up of three parts: the cerebrum (the largest part), brainstem, and cerebellum. The cerebrum has two halves (hemispheres) with different jobs, like thinking, feeling, and seeing. These hemispheres are connected by nerve paths.\n\nBrain cells, called neurons, communicate using electrical signals and chemicals called neurotransmitters. The brain is protected by the skull and fluid, but can still be damaged by injuries or diseases like strokes or Parkinson's. Scientists study the brain to understand how it works and what goes wrong in brain disorders.",
