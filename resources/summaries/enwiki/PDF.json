	"summary": "PDF is a popular file format created by Adobe in 1992. It's like a digital paper that shows documents with text and images, and it works on any computer or device. PDF files are special because they look the same no matter where you open them. They can have different types of content, like text, pictures, and even videos. You can also add extra features like forms and secure locks to keep the information safe. This format is now an official standard, called ISO 32000, with the latest update in 2020.",
