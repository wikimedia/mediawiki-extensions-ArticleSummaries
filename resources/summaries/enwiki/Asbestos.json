	"summary": "Asbestos is a natural mineral with tiny fibers that can be harmful when inhaled. It was once widely used in buildings because it resists heat and fire. However, it can cause serious lung diseases like mesothelioma and lung cancer. Many countries have banned asbestos due to health risks, but it's still used in some places. Older buildings may still have asbestos, which is dangerous if disturbed. Despite bans, many people still face health issues from past exposure.",
