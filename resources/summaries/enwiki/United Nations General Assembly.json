	"summary": "The UNGA is like a big meeting where all the countries that are part of the United Nations come together. It's where they discuss important stuff and make decisions. Each country gets one vote, and most decisions are made by a simple majority. They talk about peace, security, and how to spend the UN's money.\n\nThe UNGA is special because every member country has an equal say. It's also a place where richer and poorer countries can talk and work together. They can even make recommendations if the Security Council can't agree on something important.",
