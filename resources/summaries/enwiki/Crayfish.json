	"summary": "Crayfish are small, freshwater animals related to lobsters. They live in various habitats, from streams to swamps, and need clean water to survive. There are different types, and some can even live in polluted water. Crayfish breathe using gills and eat both living and dead plants and animals. They are an important food source in many places and are sometimes farmed, like in Wales, to protect wild populations. The name \"crayfish\" is sometimes used for saltwater species in certain countries.",
