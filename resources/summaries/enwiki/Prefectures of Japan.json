	"summary": "Japan is divided into 47 prefectures, which are like states or provinces. They are the top-level administrative divisions, each with its own government. The prefectures include cities, towns, and villages. Each has a governor and a local assembly that makes laws and decides budgets.\n\nThe Meiji government created the first prefectures in 1868 to replace old administrative systems. By 1871, all feudal domains were turned into prefectures. Over time, these were consolidated into the current 47. Some prefectures, like Tokyo, are unique, combining city and prefecture features. Every prefecture has a symbol, called a \"mon,\" to represent it.",
