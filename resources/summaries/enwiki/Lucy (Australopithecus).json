	"summary": "Lucy, or AL 288-1, is a famous fossil discovered in Ethiopia in 1974. It's a collection of bones from an ancient human-like species called Australopithecus afarensis, living about 3.2 million years ago. Lucy had a small skull like apes but walked upright like humans, showing that bipedalism came before bigger brains in human evolution. She was named after the Beatles' song \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.\" Lucy's discovery made her a global celebrity, and her story was shared in a book. The original fossils are now back in Ethiopia, with casts used for exhibitions.",
