	"summary": "Dementia is a condition that affects the brain, causing problems with thinking, memory, and behavior. It makes everyday tasks hard and can change how a person feels and acts. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause.\n\nSymptoms start slowly and get worse over time, affecting a person's independence. They might have trouble remembering things, struggle with words, or lose motivation. It's not just about getting old; it's a serious illness.\n\nDoctors use tests and scans to diagnose dementia. Some causes can be treated, but there's no cure yet. Living with dementia is challenging, but support can help improve quality of life.",
