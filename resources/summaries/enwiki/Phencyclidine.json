	"summary": "Phencyclidine (PCP), also known as angel dust, is a powerful mind-altering drug. It can make people see things that aren't there (hallucinations) and hear sounds differently. PCP is often smoked, but can also be taken by mouth, snorted, or injected. It can be mixed with other drugs like cannabis or tobacco.\n\nUsing PCP can lead to serious problems like seizures, coma, addiction, and even suicide. It's mostly used in the United States, where about 1% of 12th graders and 2.9% of adults over 25 have tried it.",
