	"summary": "The House of Lords is the less-elected, upper part of Britain's parliament, meeting in Westminster Palace. It's one of the world's oldest institutions, starting in the 11th century. Unlike the House of Commons, members aren't chosen by voting. Most are appointed for life, some are bishops from the Church of England, and a few are hereditary peers who used to inherit their seats but now have to be elected internally.\n\nThe Lords reviews laws, questions the government, and can delay new laws for up to a year. It can't make the Prime Minister resign, like the Commons can. The Lords is bigger than the Commons, with 804 members as of 2024. Before 2009, it was also the highest court of appeal.",
