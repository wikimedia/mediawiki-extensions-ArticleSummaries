It includes ideas about right and wrong, special places, and stories about the world's beginnings. Religions have different ways of worshipping, like prayers, rituals, and celebrations. There are thousands of religions worldwide, but most people follow one of the four biggest ones: Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, or Buddhism. Some people don't follow any religion and are called unaffiliated. Studying religion is important and involves many fields, like history, philosophy, and sociology.",
