	"summary": "Gilgamesh was a legendary hero from ancient Mesopotamia, whose story is told in the *Epic of Gilgamesh*. He was likely a real king of Uruk, later worshipped as a god. The epic, written in Akkadian, describes his adventures with his friend Enkidu. They fought monsters like Humbaba and the Bull of Heaven. After Enkidu's death, Gilgamesh sought immortality but failed.\n\nThe story influenced ancient Greek epics and was rediscovered in the 19th century. It caused controversy due to similarities with the Hebrew Bible. Today, Gilgamesh is a well-known figure in modern culture.",
