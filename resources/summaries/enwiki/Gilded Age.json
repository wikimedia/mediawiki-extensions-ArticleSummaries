	"summary": "The Gilded Age in the United States was a time of big changes, happening from the 1870s to the 1890s. It got its name from a book by Mark Twain. This period saw lots of economic growth, especially in the north and west, with many people moving to the cities. Wages went up, but so did poverty and the gap between rich and poor.\n\nMany Europeans came to America for work, and labor unions got stronger. Railroads and industries like oil and mining grew quickly. However, there were also big economic crashes during this time. The South struggled after the Civil War and faced racial discrimination, which took away Black people's rights.\n\nIn politics, there was a lot of corruption, but also high voter turnout. The main issues were about money, alcohol, and education. This era led to calls for reforms, which came in the following Progressive Era.",
