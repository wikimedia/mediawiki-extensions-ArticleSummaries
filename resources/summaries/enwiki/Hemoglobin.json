	"summary": "Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen around the body. It's found in most vertebrates and is essential for breathing. In humans, it makes up a large part of red blood cells and can carry four oxygen molecules. Hemoglobin also transports carbon dioxide and nitric oxide.\n\nNot only is it in blood, but hemoglobin is also found in other body cells, helping with iron metabolism and acting as an antioxidant. It's even present in some plants and fungi, where it can transport various molecules. Low levels of hemoglobin can lead to anemia.",
