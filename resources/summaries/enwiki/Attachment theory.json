According to John Bowlby, babies need these close bonds to feel safe and develop well. Babies naturally want to be near their caregivers, especially when they're scared.\n\nMary Ainsworth later discovered that babies can have different types of attachments, like secure, avoidant, or anxious. These early attachments affect how children interact in future relationships. The theory has been widely accepted and helps us understand how to best care for children.",
