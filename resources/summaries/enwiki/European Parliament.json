Every five years, citizens elect members to make decisions for the European Union (EU). It works with the Council of the EU to create laws, similar to how a national parliament works.\n\nThink of it as a super-sized democracy where over 375 million people get to have a say!  It meets mostly in Brussels, Belgium, and sometimes in Strasbourg, France. Its most important job is to make sure the EU works for everyone in Europe.",
