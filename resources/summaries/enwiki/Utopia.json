	"summary": "A utopia is an imaginary place where everything is perfect for its inhabitants. The word comes from Thomas More's 1516 book, \"Utopia,\" about a made-up island with a fair and equal society. In a utopia, people have equal chances in life, and everyone gets along. It's like a dream world!\n\nHowever, some thinkers argue that utopias are impossible because people have different wants and needs that might not always match. The opposite of a utopia is a dystopia, a place where things are very bad. Stories about utopias and dystopias are popular, helping us explore what makes a good society.",
