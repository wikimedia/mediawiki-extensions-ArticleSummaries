	"summary": "## Transformers: Power's Invisible Helpers\n\nTransformers are devices that move electricity between circuits without directly connecting them. They use a magnetic field created by coils of wire wrapped around a metal core. This lets them change the voltage of alternating current (AC) electricity, either making it higher (step-up) or lower (step-down).\n\nTransformers are crucial for sending electricity long distances and keeping our electronics safe. They come in all sizes, from tiny ones in electronics to massive units powering entire cities.",
