	"summary": "Bernoulli's principle explains how pressure, speed, and height are connected in fluids. It says that when a fluid's speed goes up, its pressure or height must go down. This was first described by Daniel Bernoulli in 1738. The principle is based on the idea that energy stays the same in a steady fluid flow. So, if a fluid moves faster, it has more kinetic energy, which comes from a drop in pressure or height. This is why the fastest flow is where pressure is lowest.",
