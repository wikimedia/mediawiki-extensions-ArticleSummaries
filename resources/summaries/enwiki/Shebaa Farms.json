	"summary": "Shebaa Farms is a small piece of land between Lebanon, Syria, and Israel. Lebanon and Syria believe it belongs to Lebanon, but Israel says it's part of the Golan Heights, which Israel controls. This disagreement has caused problems between Israel and Lebanon.\n\nThe area was once farmed by people from a Lebanese town. Over time, different countries controlled it. In 1981, Israel took over the Farms and hasn't given them back. The United Nations tried to help but couldn't decide who it belongs to. Lebanon still wants to get the land back.",
