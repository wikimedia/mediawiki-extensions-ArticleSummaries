	"summary": "Progressive rock, or \"prog,\" is a type of rock music that started in the UK in the 1960s. It's known for combining different music styles like jazz, folk, and classical. Progressive rock bands often make long, complex songs with creative lyrics and use new technology to make unique sounds. They focus on making music that's more like art, often for listening rather than dancing. Some people think of it as \"pretentious\" or \"overblown,\" but it was popular in the 1970s. After that, it split into different subgenres like neo-prog and post-progressive.",
