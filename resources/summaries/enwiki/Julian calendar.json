	"summary": "The Julian calendar, created by Julius Caesar in 46 BC, was used for over 1,600 years. It has 365 days in a normal year and 366 in a leap year every fourth year. This made the average year 365.25 days long, slightly longer than the actual solar year. In 1582, Pope Gregory XIII introduced a new calendar (Gregorian) to fix this issue. Many countries switched to the Gregorian calendar, while some Eastern Orthodox churches still use the Julian calendar for religious events.",
