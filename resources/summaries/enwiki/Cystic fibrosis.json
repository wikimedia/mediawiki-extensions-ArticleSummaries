	"summary": "Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a rare genetic disorder that mainly affects the lungs and other organs. It causes thick mucus to build up, leading to breathing problems and frequent lung infections. People with CF may also have digestive issues and salty sweat. The disorder is inherited when both parents carry a mutated CFTR gene.\n\nThere's no cure, but treatments include antibiotics for infections, medications to clear mucus, and therapy to help clear the lungs. People with CF can also take enzymes to aid digestion and vitamins for overall health. Life expectancy varies, but with proper care, many people with CF live into their 40s and 50s.",
