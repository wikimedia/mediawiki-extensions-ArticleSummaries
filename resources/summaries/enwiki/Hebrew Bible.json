	"summary": "The Hebrew Bible, also called the Tanakh, is a collection of sacred texts in Judaism. It includes the Torah, Nevi'im, and Ketuvim, and has different versions used by various Jewish groups. The Masoretic Text, a medieval version, is commonly used today and contains 24 books. Other ancient versions like the Septuagint (in Greek) and the Samaritan Pentateuch have differences from the Masoretic Text. Scholars study these variations to understand the Bible's history better. The Hebrew Bible is similar to the Christian Old Testament but with some differences in book order and content.",
