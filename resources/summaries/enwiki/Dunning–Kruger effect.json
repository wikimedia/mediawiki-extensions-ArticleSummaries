	"summary": "The Dunning-Kruger effect is when people who aren't good at something think they are better than they really are. This happens because they don't understand how well or poorly they're doing compared to others. People who are really good at something might underestimate their skills. This was first noticed by Justin Kruger and David Dunning in 1999. Studies have shown this in many areas like school exams, driving, and even medicine. Some people think it's just a statistical quirk, while others believe it's because people have trouble judging their own abilities accurately. This can lead to bad decisions, like choosing the wrong career.",
