	"summary": "The Glastonbury Festival is a big, five-day arts festival near Pilton, England. It happens most summers and has music, dance, comedy, and more. Famous artists perform, and it's shown on TV and in newspapers. About 200,000 people come, and it takes a lot of work to keep everything running smoothly. The festival started in 1970 and has happened most years since, except for some breaks every few years. It's inspired by hippie and counterculture ideas, and it raises money for charity. In 2022, headliners included Billie Eilish and Paul McCartney.",
