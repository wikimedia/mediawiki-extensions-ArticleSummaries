	"summary": "Pangolins are unique mammals with hard, protective scales made of keratin. They are sometimes called scaly anteaters and are found in Asia and Africa. These nocturnal creatures eat mostly ants and termites. They live in trees or burrows and are usually alone, except when mating or raising their young.\n\nThere are eight known species, and they are considered the most trafficked mammals globally due to poaching for their meat and scales. Deforestation also threatens their habitats. Three species are critically endangered, and several others are at risk.",
