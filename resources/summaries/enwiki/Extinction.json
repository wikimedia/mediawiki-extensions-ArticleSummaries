	"summary": "Extinction means a species has died out completely. This can happen when the last member of a species passes away, or if they can't reproduce and recover. It's hard to know exactly when this occurs. Many species, like the thylacine and dinosaurs, are now extinct.\n\nEvolution leads to new species, but they can become extinct if they can't adapt to changes or compete. Mass extinctions are rare, but individual species going extinct is common. Human activities, such as habitat destruction, are a big cause. Scientists are worried about the high rate of extinctions today.",
