	"summary": "Creative Commons is a non-profit organization that helps people share their creative works legally. It offers free licenses that explain what others can do with your work, like use it, share it, or change it. These licenses make it easier for creators to share their content without needing to negotiate rights individually. Founded in 2001, Creative Commons has grown to be widely used, with nearly 2 billion works licensed under it. Many popular platforms like Wikipedia, Flickr, and YouTube use these licenses.",
