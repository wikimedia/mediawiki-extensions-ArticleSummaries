	"summary": "Nutmeg is a spice that comes from the seed of the Myristica fragrans tree, native to Indonesia. It's used in cooking and has a unique flavor. The same tree also produces mace, another spice. Nutmeg can have strong effects if eaten in large amounts, causing reactions like allergies or even hallucinations. Despite some traditional uses, scientists haven't proven it has medical benefits. There are other plants with similar-looking seeds, but they aren't real nutmeg and aren't used as spices.",
