	"summary": "## Planck's Constant: Unlocking the Secrets of the Quantum World\n\nThe Planck constant is a tiny but crucial number in physics. It links the energy of light (photons) to their frequency and helps us understand the wave-like behavior of particles. Max Planck introduced it to explain how objects radiate heat.  Its discovery led to the birth of quantum mechanics and earned Planck a Nobel Prize. Today, it's used to define the kilogram.",
