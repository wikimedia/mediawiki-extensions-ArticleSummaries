	"summary": "In J.R.R. Tolkien's stories, wizards like Gandalf were actually immortal beings called Maiar who looked like humans. They came to Middle-earth to help after big disasters. Gandalf, Saruman, and Radagast were three of these wizards. Saruman got corrupted by power and became evil, while Gandalf helped destroy Sauron's Ring and replaced Saruman as the White Wizard. Gandalf is often compared to the Norse god Odin and even Jesus Christ. In the movies by Peter Jackson, the wizards are shown as more physical and less spiritual, but it still works well for the story.",
