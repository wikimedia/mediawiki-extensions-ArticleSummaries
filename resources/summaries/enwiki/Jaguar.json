	"summary": "## Jaguar\n\nJaguars are big cats found in the Americas. They are the largest cats in the Americas and the third largest in the world, weighing up to 348 pounds. Their coats are usually yellow-brown with spots, but some have black fur. Jaguars have powerful bites that can crack turtle shells. They live in forests and open areas, mainly in Central and South America, and are excellent swimmers.\n\nJaguars are apex predators, meaning they are at the top of the food chain. They are considered \"Near Threatened\" due to habitat loss, poaching, and conflicts with humans. Protecting their habitats is crucial for their survival. Jaguars are important in the myths of many Native American cultures.",
