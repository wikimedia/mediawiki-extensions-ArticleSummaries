	"summary": "## Quantum Mechanics Simplified\n\nQuantum mechanics is a scientific theory that explains how tiny things like atoms and electrons behave. It's different from regular physics (classical physics) because it deals with really small scales.\n\nThink of electrons in a hydrogen atom as being in different energy \"rooms\". Quantum mechanics tells us where they might be found, not exactly where they are. It also says that these tiny things can act like both particles and waves.\n\nScientists like Niels Bohr and Erwin Schr√∂dinger developed this theory to explain things classical physics couldn't, like how light is emitted from hot objects (black-body radiation) and how light can push electrons out of metals (photoelectric effect).",
