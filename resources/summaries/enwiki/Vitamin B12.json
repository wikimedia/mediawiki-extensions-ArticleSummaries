It's found in animal-based foods like meat, fish, eggs, and dairy. Humans must get it from animal sources or supplements since our bodies can't make it.\n\nA lack of B12 can cause serious health issues, especially in children, the elderly, and pregnant women. Deficiency symptoms include fatigue, memory loss, and anemia. Some people, like vegetarians and vegans, might need supplements to ensure they get enough B12.",
