	"summary": "The Staffordshire Bull Terrier, or Staffy, is a small to medium-sized dog from England. It was bred from 19th-century bull terriers by crossing bulldogs and terriers. These dogs were originally used for fighting and blood sports, but after these activities were made illegal, breeders focused on creating a more agile and game dog. The Staffy was recognized as a purebred in 1935. They are related to the Bull Terrier and American Staffordshire Terrier.",
