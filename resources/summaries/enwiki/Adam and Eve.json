	"summary": "In the Abrahamic religions, Adam and Eve are the original man and woman. The story goes that God created them to live in the Garden of Eden, but they disobeyed his rules. Eve ate fruit from a forbidden tree, and Adam joined her. This act brought knowledge but also negative things like shame and evil. As a result, God banished them from the garden.\n\nTheir story is told in the Book of Genesis, with two different accounts. It has been interpreted in various ways across different religions, sometimes with different roles for Eve. This myth has greatly influenced art, literature, and how people understand humanity's beginning.",
