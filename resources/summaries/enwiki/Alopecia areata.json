	"summary": "Alopecia areata is a condition that causes hair loss on the scalp and sometimes the whole body. It often appears as small bald spots. Stress and illness might trigger it, but often there's no clear reason. It's an autoimmune disease where the body's immune system attacks hair follicles.\n\nThere's no cure, but treatments like injections and creams can help hair regrow. Protecting the head from the sun and cold is also important. Most people with sudden hair loss regrow hair within a year, but some may experience repeated episodes. It's more common in children and females.",
