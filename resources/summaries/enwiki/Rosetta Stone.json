It has the same message written three times in different languages: hieroglyphs, Demotic, and Ancient Greek. This was super helpful for figuring out how to read hieroglyphs, which no one could do for a long time.\n\nFound in 1799, the stone helped scholars understand Ancient Egyptian history and culture. Even though there are other similar stones now, the Rosetta Stone was the first and most important key to unlocking this ancient language.",
