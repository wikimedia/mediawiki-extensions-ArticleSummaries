In the 1960s, Jamaican sound systems played a big role in its development, leading to the rise of popular artists. Ska became a hit in Jamaica and gained fans among British mods and skinheads. Over time, ska evolved into different phases, including the 2 Tone revival in Britain and the global third wave ska movement in the 1980s and 1990s.",
