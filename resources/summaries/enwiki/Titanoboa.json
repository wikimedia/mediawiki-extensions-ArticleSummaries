	"summary": "Titanoboa was a giant, extinct snake that lived after the dinosaurs, around 60 million years ago. Discovered in Colombia, it could grow up to 47 feet long and weigh over 2500 pounds, making it the largest snake known at the time. This semi-aquatic predator belonged to the boa family and mainly ate fish. Its robust, pentagonal-shaped vertebrae helped support its massive size.",
