	"summary": "## Double-Slit Experiment Simplified\n\nThe double-slit experiment shows that tiny things like light and electrons can act like both waves and particles. This is called wave-particle duality.\n\nWhen light shines through two tiny slits, it creates a pattern on a screen, like waves in water. But when we try to see which slit each tiny particle goes through, the pattern disappears. This shows that knowing where a particle goes changes how it behaves.\n\nThe experiment is important because it highlights the strange and amazing rules of quantum mechanics, which govern the tiny world of atoms and molecules.",
