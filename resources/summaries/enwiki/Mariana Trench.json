It's a crescent-shaped trench, about 1,600 miles long and 43 miles wide. The deepest point, called the Challenger Deep, is over 6,800 miles below the sea surfaceâ€”deeper than Mount Everest is tall!\n\nThe pressure at the bottom is incredibly high, over 1,000 times stronger than the pressure at sea level. Despite these extreme conditions, tiny organisms like single-celled monothalamea have been found living there.",
