It was published in 1998-1999 and later translated into English. The story came from Ito's idea of a long terraced house, using spirals for length. The manga shows how symbols usually seen positively in Japan can become horrifying. It's considered Ito's best work and has been adapted into games, a live-action film, and an upcoming anime series.",
