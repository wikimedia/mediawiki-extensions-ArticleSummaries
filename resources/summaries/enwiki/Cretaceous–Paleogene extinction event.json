	"summary": "Around 66 million years ago, a huge asteroid hit Earth, causing a mass extinction. This event, known as the K-Pg extinction, wiped out three-quarters of plant and animal species, including non-avian dinosaurs. The impact created a huge crater in Mexico and released a lot of dust and chemicals into the atmosphere, blocking sunlight and making it hard for plants to grow. This led to a global winter, affecting the food chain. Many large animals, like dinosaurs, couldn't survive. The extinction also cleared the way for other species, like mammals, to evolve and thrive.",
