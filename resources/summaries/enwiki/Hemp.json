	"summary": "Hemp, a type of cannabis plant, is an incredibly fast-growing crop with a long history of use. It's used to make many products, like paper, clothes, and even biofuel. Unlike other cannabis plants, hemp has very little of the chemical THC, which makes you high. This is why it's legal in some countries, but rules vary a lot worldwide.\n\nHemp is special because it grows quickly and can be used in so many ways, making it a valuable and sustainable resource.",
