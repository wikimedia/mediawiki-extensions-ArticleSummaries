	"summary": "ECG is a test that records the heart's electrical activity. It shows how well the heart is working and can help find problems like irregular heartbeats or damage to the heart muscle.\n\nDuring the test, electrodes (small sticky patches) are placed on the chest and limbs. These detect electrical changes when the heart beats. The ECG machine then shows these changes as waves on a screen or paper, creating a pattern that doctors can analyze. This helps them understand the heart's rhythm and any potential issues.",
