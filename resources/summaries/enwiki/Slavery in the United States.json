	"summary": "Slavery was a big part of American history, especially in the southern states, from the country's early days until 1865. It meant that people, mostly Africans and African Americans, were treated as property and could be bought and sold. This practice started during European colonization and was passed down through laws.\n\nMany northern states stopped slavery after the American Revolution, but it continued in the south, especially with the growth of the cotton industry. The country became divided over this issue. Abraham Lincoln's election in 1860 led to the Civil War, and eventually, slavery was ended by the 13th Amendment to the Constitution.",
