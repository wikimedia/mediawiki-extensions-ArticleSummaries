	"summary": "Sucrose is a type of sugar made from glucose and fructose. It's found in plants and is used to make the white sugar we eat. This sugar is made by processing sugarcane or sugar beets. The process involves crushing, washing, and dissolving the sugar, then removing impurities and crystallizing it.\n\nSucrose is often added to food and is produced in large amounts worldwide. However, it can be bad for our teeth because bacteria in our mouths turn it into a sticky substance, leading to plaque and tooth decay.",
