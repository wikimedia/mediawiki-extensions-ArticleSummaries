	"summary": "Water pollution happens when people pollute lakes, rivers, oceans, and groundwater. This can come from places like factories, farms, or cities. It hurts the environment, makes people sick if they drink it, and ruins the good things water usually provides. Pollution can be from one source like a factory, or from many places like farms. It can be toxic stuff like oil or pesticides, or things that change the water like heat or dirt. To stop this, we need good laws, technology to clean water, and smart planning.",
