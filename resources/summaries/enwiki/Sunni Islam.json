	"summary": "Sunni Islam is the biggest branch of Islam, with about 85-90% of Muslims following it. It's named after the \"Sunnah,\" which are the traditions of the Prophet Muhammad. Sunnis and Shias, another Islamic group, disagree on who should have led Muslims after Muhammad's death. Sunnis believe Abu Bakr was chosen, while Shias think it should have been Ali, Muhammad's cousin.\n\nSunni beliefs are based on the Quran, hadiths (sayings and acts of Muhammad), and consensus among Islamic scholars. They follow six main beliefs, called the \"pillars of iman,\" and respect the first four caliphs as righteous leaders.",
