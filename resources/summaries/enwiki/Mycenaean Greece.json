	"summary": "Mycenaean Greece, around 1750-1050 BC, was ancient Greece's last Bronze Age phase. It was named after Mycenae, its most famous site. The Mycenaeans developed a complex society with palaces, cities, art, and their own writing, called Linear B. They were skilled in engineering and architecture and traded across the Mediterranean. Their religion had gods similar to the later Olympic pantheon.\n\nMycenaean society was led by a king and had a strict hierarchy. It ended with the Bronze Age collapse, leading to the Greek Dark Ages. Theories suggest it was due to invasions, natural disasters, or climate change. This period inspired much of ancient Greek literature and mythology.",
