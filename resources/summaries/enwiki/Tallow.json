	"summary": "Tallow is a type of fat made by cooking animal suet, usually from cows or sheep. It's mostly used in industry and is not always made from just beef or mutton fat. Tallow can also include fat from other animals or plants. The main parts of tallow are triglycerides, which come from stearic and oleic acids. After making tallow, the remaining solid bits are called cracklings and are often used in animal food. In soap making, tallow is sometimes called tallowate.",
