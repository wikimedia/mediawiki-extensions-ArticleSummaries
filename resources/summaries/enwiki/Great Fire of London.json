	"summary": "The Great Fire of London in 1666 was a huge fire that burned down much of the city over five days. It started in a bakery on Pudding Lane and quickly spread due to strong winds and the mayor's slow response. The fire destroyed important buildings like St. Paul's Cathedral and caused social chaos, with people blaming foreigners for starting it. The king, Charles II, helped stop the fire by using gunpowder to create gaps and stop its spread. After the fire, London was rebuilt, but with the same old streets.",
