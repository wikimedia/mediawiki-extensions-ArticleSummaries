The term comes from an Italian word meaning \"rising,\" referring to the sunrise in the east. It was used for trade in the 13th and 14th centuries and later became more specific to Muslim countries in the area. Today, \"Levant\" often describes the ancient and modern culture of this region, including its cuisine and archaeology. People from this area are called Levantines.",
