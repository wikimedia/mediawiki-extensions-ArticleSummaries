	"summary": "The Dust Bowl was a time of bad dust storms in the 1930s that hurt the environment and farming in the U.S. and Canada. It was caused by a drought and people not using good farming methods. This led to topsoil being blown away. The problem lasted a few years, but some places had drought for up to eight years. It was made famous by a photo of a farmer and his sons in a dust storm, a novel called *The Grapes of Wrath*, and songs by Woody Guthrie.",
