	"summary": "GMT is the local time at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, London. It was once calculated from noon, but now it's based on midnight. GMT is also used to describe the time zone UTC+00:00 in the UK. Due to Earth's movement, noon GMT isn't always when the sun is highest at Greenwich.\n\nIn the past, astronomers started their GMT day at noon, but now it begins at midnight for everyone. To avoid confusion, Universal Time (UT) was created. Today, GMT and UT are often used interchangeably, but they might not be exactly the same. GMT is commonly used in the UK and some Arab countries.",
