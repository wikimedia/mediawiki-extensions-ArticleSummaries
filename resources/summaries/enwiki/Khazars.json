	"summary": "The Khazars were a powerful Turkic tribe that ruled a large area of Eastern Europe and Central Asia from the 7th to the 10th century. Their empire, Khazaria, was a hub for trade between Asia and Europe, controlling the Silk Road. They were known for their military strength and served as a buffer between different empires. The Khazars had a diverse population with various religious beliefs, including Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. After their capital was conquered in 969, the Khazars' influence declined, and their people spread across different regions, with some joining other tribes.",
