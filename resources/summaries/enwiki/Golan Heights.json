	"summary": "The Golan Heights is a plateau in southwest Syria, bordering Israel. It has been a disputed area since the 1967 Six-Day War, with Israel occupying two-thirds of it. Israel later annexed this part, but this is not recognized internationally. The region has a long history, dating back to the Upper Paleolithic era. It has been ruled by many empires, including the Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, Romans, and Muslims. The Golan Heights became part of modern-day Syria in 1946 but was soon disputed in the Arab-Israeli conflict. The Syrian civil war further complicated the situation, with various groups fighting for control.",
