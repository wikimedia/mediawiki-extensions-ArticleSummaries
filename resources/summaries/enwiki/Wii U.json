It's an upgrade from the Wii, with HD graphics and a unique controller called the Wii U GamePad, which has a built-in screen. You can play games on this screen or on your TV. It's compatible with old Wii games and controllers.\n\nCritics liked its controller and price, but it had some flaws, like a short battery life.
