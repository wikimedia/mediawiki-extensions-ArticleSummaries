	"summary": "Nefertiti was a powerful queen in ancient Egypt around 1370â€“1330 BC. She was married to King Akhenaten, and together they changed Egypt's religion to focus on one main god, the sun disc Aten. Their rule marked a wealthy era. After her husband's death, some think Nefertiti became a ruler herself, but this is still debated. She is famous for a beautiful stone bust, a sculpture of her head, found in an artist's studio and now displayed in Berlin.",
