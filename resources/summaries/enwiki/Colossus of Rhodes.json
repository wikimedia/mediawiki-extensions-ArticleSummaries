	"summary": "The Colossus of Rhodes was a giant statue of the sun god Helios, built around 280 BC to celebrate the city's victory over an attack. It stood about 108 feet tall, making it the tallest statue in the ancient world. An earthquake caused its collapse in 226 BC, and it was never rebuilt. In 653, Arab forces conquered Rhodes and likely sold the remains of the statue. Today, there are proposals to build a new Colossus at Rhodes Harbour, but its exact location remains unknown.",
