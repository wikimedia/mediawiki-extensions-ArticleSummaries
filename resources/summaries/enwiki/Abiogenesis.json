	"summary": "The origin of life, or abiogenesis, is the fascinating process where life emerged from non-living things. It's like a complex puzzle with many stages. Scientists believe Earth's early conditions allowed simple molecules to form and gradually become more complex. This led to the creation of cell-like structures and self-replicating molecules, possibly RNA. The last universal common ancestor (LUCA) of all life was likely a simple organism that lived billions of years ago. Researchers study ancient rocks and fossils to understand these early life forms, focusing on how they used energy and built complex molecules.",
