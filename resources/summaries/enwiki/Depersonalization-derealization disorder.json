	"summary": "This disorder makes people feel like they're outside their own body or that the world isn't real. It's often due to trauma, like abuse, in childhood. Stress or panic attacks can also cause these feelings. If they last for a long time and affect daily life, it's considered a disorder.\n\nAbout 1-2% of people experience this at some point. It's more common than once thought. The feelings can be brief for some, but for others, they can last for years.",
