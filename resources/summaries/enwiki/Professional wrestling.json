	"summary": "Professional wrestling, or pro wrestling, is like a live-action show with fighting and drama. Wrestlers put on fake fights, called matches, using real wrestling moves and cool stunts. They have unique characters and names, and the stories they tell are about good guys (faces) versus bad guys (heels). It's all planned out, but fans pretend it's real, just like when you watch a movie. This kind of wrestling started in the 19th century when wrestlers wanted to make fights more fun and exciting. Today, it's popular worldwide, with big shows and famous wrestlers becoming stars.",
