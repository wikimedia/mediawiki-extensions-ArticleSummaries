	"summary": "## Republic\n\nA republic is a type of government where power belongs to the people. They rule through representatives, unlike a monarchy where one person (a king or queen) is in charge.\n\nIn some republics, people choose their representatives through elections. However, not all republics have free and fair elections. The term \"republic\" comes from ancient Rome, where citizens elected officials and made laws. Today, many countries call themselves republics, but some limit who can participate in government.",
