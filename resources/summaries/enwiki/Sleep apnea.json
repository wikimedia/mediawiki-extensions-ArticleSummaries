	"summary": "Sleep apnea is a sleep disorder where your breathing starts and stops repeatedly. It can make you feel tired during the day because your sleep is disrupted. Common signs are snoring and feeling sleepy during the day. There are two main types: obstructive (OSA), caused by a blocked airway, and central (CSA), where your brain doesn't signal to breathe.\n\nIt's important to get checked by a doctor, who might suggest lifestyle changes, special devices like a CPAP machine, or surgery. Untreated sleep apnea can lead to serious health problems like heart disease and accidents. Many people, especially men and older adults, have it, so it's good to be aware of the symptoms.",
