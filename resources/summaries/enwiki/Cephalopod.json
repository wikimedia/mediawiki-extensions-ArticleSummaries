	"summary": "Cephalopods are a group of marine animals including squids, octopuses, cuttlefish, and nautiluses. They have a unique body structure with a prominent head and arms or tentacles. These creatures can shoot ink, which is why they are sometimes called \"inkfish.\" There are two main groups: Coleoidea (like octopuses and squid) and Nautiloidea (nautiluses). Some are tiny, like the 10mm Idiosepius, while others are huge, like the 14m colossal squid. Scientists study them in a field called teuthology.",
