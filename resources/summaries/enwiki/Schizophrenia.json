	"summary": "Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. People with schizophrenia might hear voices (hallucinations), believe things that aren't true (delusions), and have trouble organizing their thoughts. It usually starts in early adulthood and can last a lifetime.\n\nDoctors diagnose it by talking to the person and those close to them. There's no cure, but treatment with medicine and therapy can help manage the symptoms. Some people improve a lot, but others may have long-term problems. It's more common in men, and it can lead to social issues and health risks.",
