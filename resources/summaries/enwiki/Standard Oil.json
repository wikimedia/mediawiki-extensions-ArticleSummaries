	"summary": "Standard Oil was a powerful oil company that started in 1870 and became a trust in 1882. It was made up of many smaller companies controlled by a few people. By 1899, it had become the biggest corporation in the U.S., almost a monopoly. In 1911, the Supreme Court found it guilty of unfair competition and made it break into smaller companies. One of these became Exxon, now the world's largest public oil company. The others also stayed successful.",
