	"summary": "Intersex people are born with sex characteristics that don't fit typical male or female bodies. This can include chromosomes, gonads, or genitals that are not clearly one gender. About 1 in 4,500 to 2,000 babies are born intersex.\n\nIn the past, terms like \"hermaphrodite\" were used, but they are now considered offensive. The term \"disorders of sex development\" (DSD) is used in medicine, but it's also controversial.\n\nIntersex people often face discrimination and unnecessary medical treatments, which is why many advocate for their rights, like the 2013 Malta declaration. Some countries, like Malta, have made it illegal to perform non-consensual surgeries on intersex people.",
