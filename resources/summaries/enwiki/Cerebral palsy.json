Symptoms can include stiff or weak muscles, tremors, and difficulties with speech and vision. Babies with CP might reach milestones like crawling or walking later than others.\n\nThe cause is often unknown, but it can be due to brain damage during pregnancy, childbirth, or early childhood. Risk factors include premature birth and infections. CP is classified into types based on symptoms, like spastic or dyskinetic CP.\n\nThere's no cure, but treatments like therapy, medication, and surgery can help. Some people with CP can live mostly normal lives with the right support.",
