Games are played on CDs, and many popular arcade games were brought to this system.\n\nDespite a strong start in Japan, it didn't do well in the U.S. due to unexpected launch timing and tough competition from other consoles. The Saturn struggled after the Nintendo 64's release and was eventually discontinued. It's remembered for some great games but is considered a commercial failure.",
