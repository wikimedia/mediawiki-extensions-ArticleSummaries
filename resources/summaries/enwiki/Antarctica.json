	"summary": "Antarctica is Earth's coldest, driest, and windiest continent, located at the South Pole. It's the fifth largest continent, covered mostly by a thick ice sheet. This icy desert holds 70% of the world's freshwater. First seen in 1820, it's now governed by a treaty with 30 countries, banning military activity and mining. Researchers and tourists visit, studying its unique wildlife like penguins and seals. Human activity, though, affects Antarctica through pollution and climate change, especially with melting ice sheets that could raise sea levels.",
