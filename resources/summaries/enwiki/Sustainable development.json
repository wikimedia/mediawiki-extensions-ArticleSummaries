	"summary": "Sustainable development is about making sure our world can meet the needs of people today without ruining the future. It's like a balance act, ensuring we have enough resources like food, water, and energy, while also protecting the environment and taking care of each other.\n\nThe idea became famous in 1987 thanks to a report called the Brundtland Report. The United Nations also created goals in 2015 to make sustainable development happen by 2030. These goals include big challenges like ending poverty and saving our planet's wildlife.",
