	"summary": "## Gunpowder Plot\n\nIn 1605, a group of English Catholics led by Robert Catesby planned to kill King James I by exploding gunpowder in the House of Lords. They wanted religious freedom after years of persecution. Guy Fawkes, a soldier, was in charge of the explosives.\n\nAn anonymous tip led to the discovery of the plot. Fawkes was caught guarding the gunpowder and the conspirators were arrested or killed. Eight were sentenced to death.\n\nThe failed plot led to more anti-Catholic laws, but some Catholics still held important positions in the government. The event is still celebrated today as Bonfire Night.",
