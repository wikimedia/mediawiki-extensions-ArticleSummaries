	"summary": "Pancreatic cancer starts when cells in the pancreas grow out of control and form a tumor. The most common type is pancreatic adenocarcinoma, which starts in the cells that make digestive enzymes. Signs include yellow skin, belly pain, weight loss, and strange-colored stools. It rarely happens before age 40 and is more common in older adults. Smoking, obesity, and diabetes increase the risk.\n\nDoctors use imaging tests, blood tests, and biopsies to diagnose it. Treatment options are surgery, radiation, chemo, or a combination. Early detection is key, as it's one of the deadliest cancers, with low survival rates. Quitting smoking and maintaining a healthy weight can lower the risk.",
