	"summary": "Tasmania is an island state located south of mainland Australia. It's the smallest and least populated state, with about 573,000 people. The capital, Hobart, is home to 40% of Tasmanians.\n\nAboriginal people lived on the island for thousands of years before European settlement in 1803. Rising sea levels separated them from mainland Aboriginal groups. The British established a penal colony, and conflicts with settlers nearly wiped out the Aboriginal population.\n\nTasmania became a separate colony in 1825 and later gained independence. Today, its economy relies on tourism, farming, and healthcare. It's known for its beautiful nature and is a popular eco-tourism destination.",
