	"summary": "A world map shows the entire Earth's surface. It's hard to make a perfect one because our round planet has to be shown on a flat surface, which always causes some distortion. Over time, as people explored more, we learned about the Earth's coastlines and interiors, making better maps possible.\n\nThere are different types of world maps. Political maps show borders and where people live. Physical maps show landforms like mountains and soil types. Geological maps even show what's under the ground. Some maps use colors to show differences between regions, like population or wealth.",
