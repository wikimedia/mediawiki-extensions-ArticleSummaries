	"summary": "Antimatter is like the opposite of regular matter. It has particles with the same mass but opposite charges. For example, a positron is the opposite of an electron. When a particle and its antiparticle meet, they destroy each other, creating energy. This energy can be very powerful.\n\nScientists can make tiny amounts of antimatter, but it's hard and expensive to create larger amounts. It's mostly used in special medical scans and treatments. We don't see much antimatter in the universe, and scientists are still trying to figure out why.",
