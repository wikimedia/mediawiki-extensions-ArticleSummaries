	"summary": "Urea, or carbamide, is an organic compound with the formula CO(NH2)2. It's made up of two amino groups joined by a carbonyl group. Urea helps animals process nitrogen and is the main nitrogen-containing substance in mammal urine. It's a colorless, odorless, and mostly non-toxic solid that dissolves easily in water. The liver makes urea from ammonia and carbon dioxide. Urea is used in fertilizers and by the chemical industry. In 1828, Friedrich WÃ¶hler discovered how to make urea from non-living materials, proving that substances once thought to be made only by living things could be synthesized in a lab.",
