	"summary": "The Black Paintings are 14 dark and haunting artworks created by Spanish artist Francisco Goya between 1819 and 1823. Goya, who was nearly deaf, painted them on the walls of his home outside Madrid, called Quinta del Sordo. The paintings reflect his fears of insanity and a negative view of humanity, likely influenced by his health struggles and the political turmoil in Spain. Some notable paintings in the series include \"Witches' Sabbath,\" \"Saturn Devouring His Son,\" and \"Judith and Holofernes.\" These works, initially private, are now in the Museo del Prado in Madrid.",
