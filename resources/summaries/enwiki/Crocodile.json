	"summary": "Crocodiles are large, semiaquatic reptiles found in tropical regions worldwide. They are part of the Crocodilia order, which also includes alligators and caimans. While similar, these groups are distinct. Crocodiles have longer, narrower snouts and all their teeth are visible when their mouths are closed. They can tolerate saltwater better than alligators due to special salt glands. Crocodiles are more aggressive and tend to live in freshwater habitats, feeding on fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Many crocodile species are at risk of extinction.",
