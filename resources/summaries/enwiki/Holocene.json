	"summary": "The Holocene is the current geological epoch, starting about 11,700 years ago after the last ice age. It's part of the Quaternary period and is an interglacial time, meaning it's between ice ages. This epoch has seen the rise of human civilization and major changes to the Earth's ecosystems due to human activity. Scientists have divided the Holocene into three ages: Greenlandian (warming), Northgrippian (cooling due to ocean changes), and Meghalayan (recent extreme drought).",
