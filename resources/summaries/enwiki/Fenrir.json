	"summary": "Fenrir is a giant wolf in Norse mythology, known for his role in the end of the world, called Ragnarök. He is the child of the god Loki and a giantess named Angrboða. Fenrir is so powerful that the gods had to chain him up because they feared he would cause chaos. During Ragnarök, Fenrir breaks free and kills the god Odin. But don't worry, Odin's son Víðarr avenges him by killing Fenrir. This story is told in ancient texts like the Poetic Edda and Prose Edda.",
