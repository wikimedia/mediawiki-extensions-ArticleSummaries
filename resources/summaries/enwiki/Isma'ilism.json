	"summary": "Isma'ilism is a branch of Shia Islam, named after Imam Isma'il ibn Jafar. They believe in a different spiritual successor (imam) compared to the Twelver Shia. After the death of Muhammad ibn Isma'il, their teachings focused on the deeper, hidden meaning of Islam.\n\nIsma'ilis think God is one and Muhammad was the last prophet. They accept the first six imams as Twelvers do, but then recognize Isma'il as the seventh. Isma'ilism has different groups, like the Nizaris, and followers can be found all over the world.",
