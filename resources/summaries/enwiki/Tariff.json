	"summary": "## Tariffs: A Simple Explanation\n\nA tariff is a tax on imported goods. Governments use tariffs to make foreign products more expensive, encouraging people to buy locally-made items instead. The idea is to protect home industries and boost the economy.\n\nHowever, economists mostly agree that tariffs can be harmful. They can lead to higher prices, less competition, and hurt the industries they're meant to help. Free trade, without tariffs, generally benefits economies by lowering costs for everyone.",
