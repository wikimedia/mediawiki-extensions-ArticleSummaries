	"summary": "Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is a helper molecule found in all living cells that's crucial for turning food into energy. It comes in two forms: NAD+ (oxidized) and NADH (reduced), which carry electrons back and forth during metabolism. Think of them as shuttles moving energy around. NAD is made from simple building blocks or recycled from nutrients like niacin. It's also used in other important cell processes, like changing proteins. Because it's so important, scientists study it to create new medicines.",
