	"summary": "Black comedy is a type of humor that laughs at serious or sad topics. It's like making jokes about things that are usually off-limits, like death or tragedy. This kind of humor can be found in ancient Greek plays by Aristophanes and modern cartoons by Charles Addams. It's different from other funny styles, like blue comedy, which is more about rude jokes. Black comedy makes people think and feel uncomfortable while also being amused.",
