	"summary": "Plutonium (Pu) is a radioactive metal with the atomic number 94. It's naturally found in small amounts in uranium deposits. This element is named after the (now former) planet Pluto. Discovered in 1940, it was the first element made in a lab from another element (uranium).\n\nPlutonium is important for nuclear power and weapons because some of its isotopes can start and sustain nuclear reactions. However, it's dangerous to handle due to its radioactivity and tendency to accumulate in bones. Its many uses include powering spacecraft and making nuclear bombs.",
