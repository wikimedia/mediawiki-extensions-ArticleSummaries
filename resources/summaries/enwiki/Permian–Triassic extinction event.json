	"summary": "Around 251.9 million years ago, Earth experienced its worst extinction event, known as the Permian–Triassic extinction or the Great Dying. This event marked the end of the Permian period and the start of the Triassic period. A huge number of species died out, including 57% of biological families and 81% of marine species.\n\nScientists believe the main cause was massive volcanic eruptions in Siberia, which released harmful gases and caused major climate changes. Other possible factors include methane emissions and an extraterrestrial impact.",
