Countries keep POWs for different reasons, like keeping them from fighting again, showing military power, or using their labor. In history, POWs have been treated in many ways, sometimes fairly and sometimes not. In 1915, Austria held Serbian POWs for various reasons, including keeping them from returning to the war.",
