This period saw many advancements in science, technology, and the arts. Paris, in particular, became a hub for artists and writers, creating famous works. Europe was powerful and influential during this time, which is why it's often called a \"Golden Age.\" It was only later that people started calling it the Belle Époque, meaning \"Beautiful Era,\" when they compared it to the wars that came before and after.",
