	"summary": "Barley is an important grain crop grown worldwide, especially in cooler regions. It has a long history, being one of the first grains farmed over 11,000 years ago in the Middle East. Barley is versatile; most is used for animal feed, but it's also key in making beer and whisky. You can eat it in dishes like soup and bread. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and can handle dry conditions. In 2022, 155 million tons of barley were produced, making it the fourth largest grain crop.",
