	"summary": "Monotremes are unique mammals that lay eggs instead of giving birth to live young. There are only five species left today: the platypus and four echidnas. They are different from other mammals in many ways, like their brain and body structures. Female monotremes feed their babies milk, just like other mammals.\n\nThese animals are native to Australia and New Guinea. Scientists believe they used to live in South America and Antarctica too, millions of years ago. The name 'monotreme' means 'single hole,' referring to their cloaca, a single opening for their digestive and reproductive systems.",
