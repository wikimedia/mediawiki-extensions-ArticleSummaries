	"summary": "Scoliosis is when your spine curves in an \"S\" or \"C\" shape instead of a straight line. It might not cause problems if it's mild, but severe cases can make breathing and moving hard. The cause is often unknown, but it can run in families or be due to other health issues. Scoliosis usually starts during teenage years.\n\nDoctors use X-rays to diagnose it. Treatment depends on how bad it is. This can include wearing a brace, doing special exercises, or even surgery. Girls are more likely to have severe scoliosis than boys.",
