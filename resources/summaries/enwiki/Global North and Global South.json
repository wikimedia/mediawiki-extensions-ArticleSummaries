	"summary": "The world's countries are often divided into two groups: the Global North and Global South. This classification is based on economics and politics. The Global North includes richer, developed nations like the USA, Canada, Europe, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. They have higher living standards and stronger economies.\n\nThe Global South comprises developing and least developed countries in Africa, Latin America, parts of Asia, and Oceania. These countries often face challenges like poverty, low incomes, and poor healthcare. They mainly rely on agriculture and natural resources.\n\nThese terms help us understand the differences in wealth and development between countries.",
