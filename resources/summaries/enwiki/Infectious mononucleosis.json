	"summary": "Infectious mononucleosis, often called \"mono\" or \"glandular fever,\" is an infection usually caused by the Epstein-Barr virus. Most people get it as kids without showing many symptoms. In young adults, it can cause fever, sore throat, swollen neck glands, and tiredness, which may last for months. The liver or spleen might also swell, and in rare cases, the spleen can rupture. Mono is spread through saliva, and sometimes by blood or semen. It's diagnosed by symptoms and blood tests. There's no vaccine, but you can prevent it by not sharing personal items with infected people. Mono usually goes away on its own, helped by rest, fluids, and pain relievers.",
