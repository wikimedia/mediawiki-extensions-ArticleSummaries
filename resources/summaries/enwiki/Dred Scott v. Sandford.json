	"summary": "This famous court case was about a slave, Dred Scott, who sued for his freedom. The Supreme Court ruled against him, saying that Black people were not citizens and had no rights under the Constitution. This decision was seen as very unfair and racist, and it made tensions between slave and free states worse, leading up to the Civil War. The case is now considered one of the worst decisions in the Court's history.",
