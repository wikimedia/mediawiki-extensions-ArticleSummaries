	"summary": "Euthanasia is when someone ends a life to stop pain and suffering. Different countries have different rules about it. Some allow it if the person asks for it (voluntary euthanasia). Others might allow it if the patient can't make decisions (non-voluntary) under strict conditions. Euthanasia without consent (involuntary) is illegal and considered murder.\n\nOnly a few countries have legal active euthanasia, like Belgium and Canada. Many more allow passive euthanasia, which is stopping treatment to let someone die. This is a big topic in bioethics, with many people having strong opinions on what's right.",
