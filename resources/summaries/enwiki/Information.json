Information can be sent through different ways, like writing, sounds, or even pictures.\n\nSometimes, information is like a puzzle. We need to figure out its meaning by interpreting it. The more unclear or surprising the information, the more it can help us learn and understand. We often use computers and technology to store and share information.",
