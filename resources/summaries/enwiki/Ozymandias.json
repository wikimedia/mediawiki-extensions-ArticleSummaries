	"summary": "\"Ozymandias\" is a poem by Percy Bysshe Shelley, first published in 1818. It's about the Egyptian pharaoh Ramesses II, known as Ozymandias in Greek. Shelley wrote it as part of a friendly competition with another poet. The poem shows how time destroys even the greatest things, like the pharaoh's statue, leaving only a broken, lonely fragment in the desert. It reminds us that nothing lasts forever.",
