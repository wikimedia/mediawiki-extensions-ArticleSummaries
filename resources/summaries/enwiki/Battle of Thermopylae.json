	"summary": "The Battle of Thermopylae happened in 480 BC between the Persian Empire and a group of Greek city-states led by Sparta. The Greeks, led by Leonidas, tried to stop the massive Persian army at a narrow pass called Thermopylae. Although heavily outnumbered, the Greeks held off the Persians for three days. A local man named Ephialtes told the Persians about a secret path, leading to the Greeks' defeat. Leonidas and his 300 Spartans fought to the death to protect the rest of the Greek army. This battle is famous for showing the power of a small, well-trained army defending their land.",
