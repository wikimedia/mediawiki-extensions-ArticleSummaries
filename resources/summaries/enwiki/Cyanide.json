	"summary": "Cyanide is a chemical compound with a carbon-nitrogen bond. It can be found in both organic (nitriles) and inorganic forms. Inorganic cyanides, like sodium and potassium cyanide, are very poisonous salts. Hydrocyanic acid (HCN) is a toxic liquid produced from cyanide salts. Organic cyanides, or nitriles, have the cyanide group attached to a carbon atom. While less reactive, some organic cyanides can still release cyanide ions and be toxic.",
