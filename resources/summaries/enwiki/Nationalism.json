	"summary": "Nationalism is the belief that a country should be ruled by its own people and have its own government, free from outside control. It encourages people from the same nation, who share things like culture, language, and history, to come together. There are different types of nationalism, but the main ones are ethnic (based on shared ancestry) and civic (based on shared values and citizenship). Nationalism can lead to good things like pride in one's country and fighting for justice, but it can also cause problems like discrimination and war.",
