	"summary": "## Opium\n\nOpium is a sticky substance taken from the seed pods of the opium poppy. It contains morphine, a strong painkiller, and other chemicals. People have used it for thousands of years as medicine, but it can also be misused as a drug.\n\nTo get opium, people make small cuts in the poppy pods, and the sticky latex spills out and dries.  It's then scraped off and dried.  Opium is often turned into heroin, a very powerful and dangerous drug.",
