	"summary": "UFOs are strange things seen in the sky that can't be explained right away. Most of the time, these sightings turn out to be regular objects or natural events. People have reported seeing UFOs for a long time, but they became really popular after World War II. Many groups and scientists have looked into UFO reports, but they haven't found proof of aliens or other supernatural causes. Some people believe UFOs are from outer space, but experts think they are likely just mistakes or hoaxes. The U.S. government still studies these sightings to be sure.",
