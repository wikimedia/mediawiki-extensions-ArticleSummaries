	"summary": "Libertarianism is a political belief that freedom is very important. Libertarians think people should have lots of personal freedom and equal rights, like speaking your mind or joining groups. They don't like powerful governments or big armies.\n\nThere are different kinds of libertarians. Some, called left-libertarians, want to share wealth equally and get rid of private ownership. Others, right-libertarians, want less government control and strong private property rights. This type is popular in the U.S. and other countries. Recently, libertarian leaders have been elected in Chile and Argentina.",
