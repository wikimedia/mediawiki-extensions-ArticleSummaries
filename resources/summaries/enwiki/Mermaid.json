	"summary": "Mermaids are mythical creatures with a human female top half and a fish tail. They feature in stories from Europe, Asia, and Africa. Sometimes mermaids are dangerous, linked to storms and shipwrecks, but they can also be kind and fall in love with humans. Male mermaids, called mermen, also exist in these tales.\n\nThe idea of mermaids might have come from ancient Greek sirens. People have claimed to see mermaids, but these were likely manatees. Mermaids remain popular in art, books, and movies, like \"The Little Mermaid\" by Hans Christian Andersen.",
