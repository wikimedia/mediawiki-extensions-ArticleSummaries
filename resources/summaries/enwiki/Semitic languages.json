	"summary": "Semitic languages are a group of related languages spoken by millions across West Asia, North Africa, and parts of Europe and North America. They belong to the Afroasiatic language family. Some well-known Semitic languages include Arabic, Hebrew, and Aramaic.\n\nThese languages have a long history, with written records dating back to around 2600 BCE in West Asia. They are known for their unique way of forming words using root consonants, often three in a \"triliteral root.\" Vowels are then added to create words, like \"write\" becoming \"book\" or \"writer\" in Arabic.\n\nMany Semitic languages use scripts that only write consonants, like Arabic and Hebrew, while others, like Maltese, use the Latin alphabet.",
