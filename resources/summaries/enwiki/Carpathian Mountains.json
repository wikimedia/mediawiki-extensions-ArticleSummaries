The highest peaks are in the Tatra Mountains, reaching over 8,500 feet. These mountains are home to many animals like bears and wolves, and they have lots of unique plants. Romania, in particular, has a lot of forest areas and natural springs. Unfortunately, some parts of the Carpathians are being damaged by illegal tree cutting.",
