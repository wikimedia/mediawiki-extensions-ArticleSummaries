	"summary": "The Taíno were an Indigenous group who lived in the Caribbean when European explorers arrived in the 1400s. They were the main residents of many islands, including Cuba, Hispaniola (now the Dominican Republic and Haiti), Jamaica, and Puerto Rico. Christopher Columbus first met the Taíno in the Bahamas.\n\nTaíno society was based on farming, with leaders called caciques. They believed in spirits called zemis. Over time, some people think the Taíno mixed with African and Spanish cultures. However, many modern Caribbean people still connect with Taíno heritage and traditions, and some have Taíno DNA.",
