	"summary": "The Portuguese Empire was one of the oldest and largest colonial empires in the world, lasting from 1415 to 1999. It began when Portuguese explorers started sailing and trading along the African coast. Over time, they established colonies in Africa, North and South America, Asia, and Oceania.\n\nAt its peak, the empire had many trading posts and controlled important sea routes. However, after facing attacks from other European powers and losing Brazil's independence in the 19th century, the empire declined. In the 20th century, Portugal's colonies in Africa and Asia fought for independence, leading to their decolonization. Today, the Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries keeps the cultural legacy of this vast empire alive.",
