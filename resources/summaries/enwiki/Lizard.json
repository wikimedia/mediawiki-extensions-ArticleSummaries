	"summary": "Lizards are a diverse group of over 7,000 reptile species found worldwide, except in Antarctica. They vary in size, from tiny chameleons to the massive Komodo dragon. Most lizards walk on four legs, but some have evolved snake-like bodies without legs. They are often territorial and use bright colors to communicate. Lizards are mostly meat-eaters, hunting insects or even large mammals. They have unique defenses, like venom, camouflage, and the ability to lose and regrow their tails to escape predators.",
