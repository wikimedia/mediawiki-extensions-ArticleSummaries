	"summary": "Benzodiazepines, or \"benzios,\" are strong drugs used to help with problems like anxiety, sleep issues, and seizures. They work by calming the brain and were first made in the 1950s. Many people use them, but they should only be taken for a short time because they can cause serious side effects if used too long. These include memory loss, feeling more anxious, and even increasing the risk of suicide. Mixing them with alcohol or other drugs can be very dangerous. It's important to be careful with these medications and follow a doctor's advice.",
