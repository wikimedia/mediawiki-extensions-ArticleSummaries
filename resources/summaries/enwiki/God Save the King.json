Its creator is unknown, but it might have roots in traditional church music. This melody has been used in many countries for royal and patriotic songs. In the United States, it's the basis for \"My Country, 'Tis of Thee.\" Usually, only one verse is sung, but the full song has many versions with different verses added or removed over time. It's also used as a royal salute for the British monarch and their family.",
