	"summary": "Sertraline, often known by the brand name Zoloft, is a type of antidepressant called an SSRI. It helps with depression and other issues like anxiety and OCD. While it has some side effects like diarrhea, nausea, and sleep problems, it's generally better tolerated than older antidepressants. It's important to note that it might increase the risk of suicidal thoughts in younger people and should not be taken with certain other medications. Sertraline was developed by Pfizer and is now a widely used generic drug.",
