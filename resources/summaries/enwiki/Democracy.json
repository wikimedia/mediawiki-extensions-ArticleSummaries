	"summary": "Democracy is a government system where power belongs to the people. It allows everyone to vote and have a say in how their country is run. This can be done directly, like in ancient Greece, where people gathered to make decisions, or through representatives, like in most countries today.\n\nThe word 'democracy' comes from ancient Greece, meaning \"rule of the people.\" Over time, democracy has changed, and now most countries use a system where citizens elect leaders to make decisions for them. This is called representative democracy.",
