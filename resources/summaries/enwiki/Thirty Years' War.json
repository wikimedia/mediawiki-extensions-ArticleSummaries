	"summary": "The Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) was a huge conflict in Europe, mainly in Central Europe. It started because of religious disagreements between Catholics and Lutherans, but soon became about who would rule Europe, with Spain and France fighting for power. Many people died from fighting, hunger, or disease. The war ended with the Peace of Westphalia, which gave more power to France and let some areas, like Bavaria and Saxony, govern themselves more.",
