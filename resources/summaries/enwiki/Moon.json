	"summary": "## Moon\n\nThe Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. It takes about 29.5 days to orbit Earth and rotate on its axis, always showing the same side to us. The Moon's gravity causes Earth's tides. It formed around 4.5 billion years ago from debris after Earth collided with a Mars-sized object.\n\nThe lunar surface has mountains, craters, and dark \"seas\" of cooled magma. We see different phases of the Moon as it orbits Earth. Humans first landed on the Moon in 1969 during the Apollo 11 mission. Future crewed missions are planned.",
