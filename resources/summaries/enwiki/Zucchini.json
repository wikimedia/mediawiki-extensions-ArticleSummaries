	"summary": "Zucchini, also known as courgette or baby marrow, is a type of summer squash. It's a green (or sometimes yellow/orange) vegetable that's harvested when its seeds and skin are still soft. Zucchini grows on a vine and can reach up to 3 feet long, but is usually picked when it's 6 to 10 inches. It's used like a vegetable in cooking, but technically, it's a type of berry. Zucchini was first grown in Mesoamerica thousands of years ago but was bred in Milan, Italy, in the 1800s. Be careful, as some zucchini can be bitter and cause stomach problems due to a substance called cucurbitacin.",
