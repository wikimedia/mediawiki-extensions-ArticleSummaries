	"summary": "Xenophobia means fearing or disliking people from other countries or cultures. It comes from ancient Greek words meaning \"strange\" and \"fear.\" This feeling often makes people think their group is better than others. They might suspect or even want to get rid of those they see as different. Xenophobia can make it hard for different groups to live together peacefully. It's like being scared of something just because it's new or different.",
