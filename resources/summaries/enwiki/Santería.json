	"summary": "Santería is a religion that started in Cuba when African slaves mixed their Yoruba beliefs with Roman Catholicism. It has no central leader but is practiced by \"believers\" called *creyentes*. Followers worship spirits called *oricha*, linked to Catholic saints, who influence people's lives. They believe in a creator, Olodumare, and use rituals to connect with the *oricha*. These rituals include drumming, singing, and animal sacrifices. Santería developed after slavery, and its temples, called *ilés*, are run by priests and priestesses. It spread internationally after the Cuban Revolution.",
