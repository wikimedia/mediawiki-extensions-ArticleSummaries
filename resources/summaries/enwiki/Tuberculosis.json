	"summary": "Tuberculosis is a serious disease caused by bacteria. It mainly affects the lungs but can also harm other body parts. Many people have no symptoms, but 10% may develop a serious illness if not treated. Symptoms include a bad cough, fever, and weight loss.\n\nTB spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or talks. It's more common in people with weak immune systems or who smoke. Doctors use X-rays and tests to diagnose it.\n\nPrevention includes vaccination and early treatment. Antibiotics are used to treat TB, but some bacteria are becoming resistant. In 2022, around 10.6 million people got TB, and 1.3 million died, mostly in Asia and Africa.",
