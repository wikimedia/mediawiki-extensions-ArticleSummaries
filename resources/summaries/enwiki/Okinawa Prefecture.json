	"summary": "Okinawa Prefecture is the southernmost and westernmost part of Japan. It includes many islands, with Naha as its capital. The prefecture has a unique history, once ruled by the Ryukyu Kingdom and later becoming part of Japan in 1879. After World War II, the U.S. occupied Okinawa until 1972. Today, many U.S. military bases are still in Okinawa, which is a point of debate. Okinawa is known for its beautiful islands and unique Ryukyuan culture.",
