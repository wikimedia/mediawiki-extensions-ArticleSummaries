	"summary": "## Circle of Fifths\n\nThe circle of fifths is a way to organize musical notes. It starts with C and moves up by perfect fifths (seven half-steps): C, G, D, A, E, B, F♯/G♭, and so on. This pattern repeats every 12 notes, going up seven octaves. It helps show which keys are closely related.  In equal temperament tuning, the circle doesn't perfectly \"close\" back on itself.",
