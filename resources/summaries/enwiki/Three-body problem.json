	"summary": "In physics, the three-body problem is about predicting how three objects move when they affect each other with gravity. Scientists use this to study things like planets, moons, and stars. It's hard to solve because the objects' movements are often chaotic and change over time. Unlike simpler problems, there's no easy formula to find exact answers. Instead, computers help us estimate the objects' paths using complex calculations.",
