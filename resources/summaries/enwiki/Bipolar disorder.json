	"summary": "Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition where people experience extreme mood swings. It was once called manic depression. People with this disorder have periods of feeling very happy and energetic (mania) and times of deep sadness (depression). Mania can lead to impulsive decisions, less sleep, and feeling very irritable. Depression may cause crying, negative thoughts, and self-harm.\n\nThe exact cause is unknown, but genes and environment play a role. It affects around 2% of people worldwide and often starts in early adulthood. Treatment includes mood stabilizer medications, therapy, and sometimes electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Managing bipolar disorder is crucial to prevent suicide and improve daily functioning.",
