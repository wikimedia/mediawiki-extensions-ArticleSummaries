	"summary": "Menudo was a super popular Latin boy band from Puerto Rico, formed by Edgardo Díaz. They were one of the biggest boy bands ever, with hits on the radio and in movies and TV. The original group had five young boys, including Díaz's cousins. Their \"golden era\" lineup included future stars Ricky Martin and Draco Rosa. In the 1990s, Menudo faced problems with drug use and abuse allegations, leading to a change in management and the sale of the band's name. They've sold millions of albums and made a lot of money, and some members still perform together today.",
