	"summary": "Bronchitis is when your airways in the lungs get swollen and make you cough. It often starts with a cold or infection and can cause wheezing, breathlessness, and chest pain. There are two types:\n\n- **Acute**: A short, nasty cough that lasts a few weeks. Viruses usually cause it, but bacteria can too. Rest and medicine for fever help.\n\n- **Chronic**: A long-term problem with a cough that brings up mucus. Smoking is the main cause. Quitting smoking and medicine can help manage it.\n\nMany people get acute bronchitis, but chronic bronchitis is less common.",
