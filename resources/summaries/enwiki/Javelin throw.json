	"summary": "Javelin throw is a sport where athletes throw a spear-like object, called a javelin, as far as they can. The javelin is around 8 feet long. Competitors run within a marked-off area to build up speed before releasing the javelin. This event is part of the decathlon for men and the heptathlon for women, which are multi-sport competitions. It's all about combining a good running start with a strong throw to achieve the greatest distance.",
