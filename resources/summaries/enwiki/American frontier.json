	"summary": "The American frontier, or the Old West, was a time of big changes in the United States. It started with European settlers in the 1600s and ended in 1912 when the last new states joined the country. Many people moved west after President Thomas Jefferson bought new land, believing it was their right to expand. This idea is called \"manifest destiny.\" The stories and legends from this time have become a big part of American culture, especially in movies and books about the Wild West.",
