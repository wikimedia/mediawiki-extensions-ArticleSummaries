	"summary": "Television (TV) is a way to send moving pictures and sound to people's homes. It's a popular tool for entertainment, news, and advertising. TV started in the 1920s but became common after World War II. At first, it was black and white, but color TV arrived in the 1960s.\n\nOver time, TV technology improved. We moved from big, heavy screens to thin, flat ones. We can now watch TV online or on-demand, and many people use streaming services like Netflix. Most homes worldwide have a TV, and it's still a significant way to share information and stories.",
