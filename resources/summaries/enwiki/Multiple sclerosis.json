	"summary": "Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease that affects the brain and spinal cord. It damages the protective coating around nerve cells, making it hard for the body to send signals. This can cause different symptoms like vision loss, weakness, and coordination problems. MS can be relapsing, where symptoms come and go, or progressive, where they get worse over time. The cause is unknown, but it might be related to the immune system or genetics. There's no cure, but treatment can help manage symptoms and prevent attacks. It's more common in women and usually starts between ages 20 and 50.",
