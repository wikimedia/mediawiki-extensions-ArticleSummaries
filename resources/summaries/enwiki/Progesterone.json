	"summary": "Progesterone is a natural hormone in our bodies, mainly in women. It plays a big role in the monthly menstrual cycle, when a woman's body gets ready for a possible pregnancy. During pregnancy, it helps the baby grow and keeps the uterus healthy. This hormone is also important for making other hormones, like sex hormones and those that help with stress.\n\nDoctors sometimes give progesterone as a medicine to help with birth control, prevent certain cancers, or to balance hormones. It's been used since the 1930s.",
