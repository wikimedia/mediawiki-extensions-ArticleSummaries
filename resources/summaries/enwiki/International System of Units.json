	"summary": "## International System of Units (SI)\n\nThe International System of Units (SI) is the world's most used measurement system. It's based on seven main units: second (time), meter (length), kilogram (mass), ampere (electric current), kelvin (temperature), mole (amount of substance), and candela (brightness).\n\nSI uses prefixes to make units bigger or smaller (like kilometers or millimeters). It's constantly updated to keep up with scientific advancements. Originally developed to replace the confusing variety of units in the CGS system, SI standardized measurements for everyone.",
