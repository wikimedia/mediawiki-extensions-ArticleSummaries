	"summary": "The Barbary lion, also known as the North African lion, once lived in the mountains and deserts of North Africa. It went extinct due to firearms and bounties. Recent studies show it's not a unique subspecies, but closely related to Asiatic and some African lions. Fossils found in Morocco reveal its presence there over 100,000 years ago. Though gone from North Africa, its genetic legacy lives on within the broader lion population.",
