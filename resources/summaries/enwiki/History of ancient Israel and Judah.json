	"summary": "The history of ancient Israel and Judah starts around 1208 BCE when the Israelites settled in Canaan. The two kingdoms of Israel and Judah formed in the Iron Age. The Hebrew Bible tells of a united kingdom before 900 BCE, but historians believe they were separate kingdoms. Israel was conquered around 720 BCE, and Judah later faced destruction in 586 BCE under Babylonian rule. This led to the exile of Jews to Babylon, where their religion evolved into Judaism. The exile ended when the Achaemenid Empire took over Babylon, allowing Jews to return and rebuild their temple.",
