	"summary": "Haka is a traditional Māori dance, often performed by a group with energetic movements and rhythmic stomping. It's used for various occasions like welcoming guests or celebrating achievements. Both men and women can perform haka, and it's even taught in schools through Kapa haka groups. The All Blacks, New Zealand's rugby team, made haka famous worldwide by doing it before matches, a tradition that started in 1905. However, it's not just a war dance, as some might think, and should be performed with respect to Māori culture.",
