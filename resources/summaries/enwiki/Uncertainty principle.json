	"summary": "## Uncertainty Principle Simplified\n\nThe Uncertainty Principle, discovered by Werner Heisenberg in 1927, says we can't know everything about a tiny particle at the same time. Specifically, the more precisely we measure its position (where it is), the less we know about its momentum (how fast it's moving), and vice versa. This is because these measurements are like opposite sides of a coin â€“ knowing one makes the other less certain. The principle is written as a math equation, but the idea is that nature itself has limits on what we can know.",
