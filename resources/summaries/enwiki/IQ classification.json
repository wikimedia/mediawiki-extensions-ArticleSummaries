	"summary": "IQ tests measure intelligence and use scores to categorize people's abilities. A score of 100 is considered average, with higher and lower scores indicating above-average or below-average intelligence, respectively. This system is called \"deviation IQ.\" Most people score between 85 and 115, and only 5% score above 125.\n\nEarly IQ tests showed that children's scores were similar across different tests. However, the same person might get different scores if they take the same test again or use different test brands. There's no universal system for naming IQ categories, and early intelligence classification relied on observing behavior. Modern IQ tests consider reliability and errors to ensure accurate classification.",
