	"summary": "Visible light is the part of electromagnetic radiation that our eyes can see. It includes colors like red, green, and blue, with wavelengths from 400 to 700 nanometers. Light with longer wavelengths appears red, while shorter wavelengths look green or blue.\n\nNatural light comes mainly from the Sun. Historically, fire was also a significant light source, but now electric lights are more common. Light has various properties, such as intensity and wavelength, and it travels at a constant speed in a vacuum. Understanding light is crucial in physics, especially in a field called optics.",
