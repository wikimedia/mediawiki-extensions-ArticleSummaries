	"summary": "Central America is a region in North America, bordered by Mexico, Colombia, the Caribbean Sea, and the Pacific Ocean. It includes seven countries: Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama. This area is known for its diverse wildlife and frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions due to its active geologic faults.\n\nHistorically, Central America was home to Mesoamerican and Isthmo-Colombian indigenous peoples. It was colonized by Spain after Christopher Columbus's voyages. In 1821, it gained independence and formed the Federal Republic of Central America, which later dissolved. Today, most countries maintain a Central American identity.",
