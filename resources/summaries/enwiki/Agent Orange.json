	"summary": "Agent Orange is a powerful herbicide used during the Vietnam War. It was a mixture of chemicals, mainly 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T, which contained a harmful substance called dioxin. This defoliant was sprayed over Vietnam's forests to clear them, but it had terrible consequences.\n\nMany people, including Vietnamese civilians and U.S. soldiers, suffered health problems like cancer and birth defects due to exposure. The environment was also severely damaged, with forests destroyed and animal diversity reduced. This led to legal battles, with victims seeking compensation.\n\nFirst used by British forces in Malaya, Agent Orange's devastating effects have been recognized as an ecocide.",
