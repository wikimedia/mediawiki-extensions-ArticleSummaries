	"summary": "Humanism is a way of thinking that puts humans first. It believes people are important and can make their own decisions. This idea started in Italy a long time ago, when people studied old books and felt inspired. Over time, humanism grew with new discoveries in science. Now, it's a global movement, especially in Europe and the USA.\n\nModern humanists care about making the world better for everyone. They believe in freedom, equality, and using reason to understand things. They don't rely on religion to guide them but think morality comes from within us. Humanists support rights, free speech, and democracy. They have their own groups, like Humanists International, Humanists UK, and the American Humanist Association.",
