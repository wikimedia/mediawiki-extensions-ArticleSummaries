	"summary": "Solid-state drives (SSDs) are fast storage devices that use flash memory instead of spinning disks. They have no moving parts, making them quicker, more durable, and quieter than traditional hard drives (HDDs). SSDs are used in computers, servers, and phones, offering faster data access and lower power use.\n\nThere are different types of SSDs, like SATA, PCIe, and NVMe, with varying speeds. They can be more expensive and have a limited number of times you can write data, but they are becoming more popular, especially for important tasks and in consumer devices. Some SSDs even combine with HDDs to offer better performance at a lower cost.",
