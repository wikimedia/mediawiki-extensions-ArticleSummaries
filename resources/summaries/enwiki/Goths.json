	"summary": "The Goths were ancient Germanic tribes who influenced history significantly. When their lands were invaded by the Huns, some Goths joined them, while others moved west into the Roman Empire. These migrants, known as Visigoths, defeated the Romans at the Battle of Adrianople. They later established a kingdom in Spain. Another group, the Ostrogoths, gained independence from the Huns and ruled Italy. Over time, Gothic kingdoms were conquered, but their name lives on in architecture and literature. The Goths' migration and battles contributed to the end of the Roman Empire and the start of medieval Europe.",
