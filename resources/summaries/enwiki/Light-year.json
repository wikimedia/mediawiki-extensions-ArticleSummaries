	"summary": "A light-year is a unit of length used to measure distances in space. It's defined as the distance light travels in one year, which is about 5.88 trillion miles or 9.46 trillion kilometers. Even though its name includes \"year,\" it's not a unit of time. Light-years are commonly used to express distances to stars and other celestial objects in popular science. Professional astronomers often use a different unit called a parsec, which is roughly 3.26 light-years.",
