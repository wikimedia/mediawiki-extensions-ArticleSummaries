	"summary": "In Greek mythology, Charon is the guide who takes souls to the underworld. He sails a boat across rivers that separate the living from the dead. People in ancient Greece even buried coins with the dead, hoping Charon would accept them as payment. If not, souls had to wait for a long time before crossing. Charon also helped some heroes, like Heracles and Aeneas, travel to and from the underworld.",
