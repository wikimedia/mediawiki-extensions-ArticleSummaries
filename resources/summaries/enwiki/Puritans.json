	"summary": "Puritans were English Protestants who wanted to reform the Church of England in the 16th and 17th centuries. They believed the church was too similar to the Roman Catholic Church and needed to be more Protestant. Puritans sought to make changes in worship, doctrine, and personal behavior. They were divided on how to organize the church, with some wanting a uniform national church and others preferring independent congregations. After facing persecution, many Puritans left England and settled in North America, especially in New England. Their beliefs influenced various Protestant denominations.",
