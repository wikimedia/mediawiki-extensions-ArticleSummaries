	"summary": "The date palm (*Phoenix dactylifera*) is a tall, slow-growing tree from the palm family, known for its sweet fruit called dates. It's native to northern Africa and the Middle East but is now grown in many tropical and subtropical areas. Dates are oval, around 3-7 cm long, and can be dark brown, red, or yellow. They're very sweet, with up to 68% sugar, and are often eaten as a dessert. People have been farming dates in Arabia since 6000 BCE, and they are important in many religions.",
