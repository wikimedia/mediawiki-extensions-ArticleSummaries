	"summary": "The dire wolf, an extinct species of canine, lived in the Americas during the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene epochs, around 125,000 to 9,500 years ago. It was named in 1858 and had two recognized subspecies. The largest collection of its fossils was found in the Rancho La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles. Dire wolves were about the same size as modern gray wolves, weighing between 132 to 150 lbs. They had larger teeth and stronger bites, adapted for hunting megaherbivores like horses, sloths, and mastodons. Their extinction is linked to the disappearance of their prey, climate change, and competition from other species.",
