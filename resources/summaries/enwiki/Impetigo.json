	"summary": "Impetigo is a common skin infection caused by bacteria, usually seen in children. It often appears as yellowish crusts on the face, arms, or legs, and sometimes as large blisters in the groin or armpits. The skin may feel itchy or painful.\n\nThis condition is spread through direct contact and can be prevented by good hand hygiene and avoiding infected individuals. Treatment involves antibiotic creams or, in severe cases, oral antibiotics. Impetigo usually heals without scars, but complications like cellulitis can occur if left untreated. It's important to seek medical advice for proper diagnosis and treatment.",
