It was an important city-state, with its first recorded king, King Tuttues, ruling around the 26th century BC. The city was dedicated to the moon god Nanna, and its name means \"abode of Nanna.\" The most notable ruin is the Ziggurat of Ur, a temple built for Nanna around 2100 BC and later reconstructed. Ur was once by the Persian Gulf, but the coastline has moved, leaving it inland.",
