	"summary": "The speed of sound is how fast sound travels, which is about 767 miles per hour in air at room temperature. It's faster in solids and liquids. For example, sound moves about 15 times faster in iron than in air.\n\nSound's speed depends on the material it's traveling through and the temperature. In theory, it's the speed of vibrations. Understanding the speed of sound is important in fields like fluid dynamics and seismology.",
