	"summary": "Plants are living things in the Plantae kingdom that mostly get energy from sunlight through a process called photosynthesis. They use green pigments called chlorophyll to make sugars from water and carbon dioxide. Some plants, like parasites, can't do this and get energy from other plants or fungi. Most plants are made up of many cells and include things like algae and land plants. There are about 380,000 known plant species, and they produce oxygen and food for many animals. People use plants for food, medicine, and building materials. The study of plants is called botany.",
