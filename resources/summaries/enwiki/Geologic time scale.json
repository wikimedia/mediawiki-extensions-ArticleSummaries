	"summary": "The geologic time scale is like a giant calendar that scientists use to understand Earth's history. It's based on the layers of rocks (called strata) found in the ground. By studying these layers, scientists can figure out when major events happened on our planet, like when dinosaurs lived or when huge ice sheets covered the Earth. This time scale is divided into different units, and each unit represents a specific period of time. The International Commission on Stratigraphy is in charge of making sure these time units are standardized and used correctly by scientists all around the world.",
