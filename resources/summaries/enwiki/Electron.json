Think of them as the glue that holds atoms together.\n\nElectrons can act like both particles and waves, which means they can move like tiny balls but also spread out like ripples in a pond. This makes them important in lots of technology, like batteries, electronics, and even solar panels.\n\nScientists discovered electrons in the late 1800s, and they've been studying them ever since.",
