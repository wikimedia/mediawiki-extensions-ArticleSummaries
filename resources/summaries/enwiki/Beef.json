However, eating too much, especially processed beef, can increase the risk of certain cancers and heart disease.\n\nHumans have been eating beef since prehistoric times, domesticating cattle for meat. Many breeds are now raised for their high-quality meat. While popular worldwide, some religions, like Hinduism, forbid beef consumption due to cultural and religious beliefs.",
