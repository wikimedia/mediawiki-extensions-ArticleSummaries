It was the tomb of pharaoh Khufu and took about 26 years to construct. Initially standing at 481 feet, it was the world's tallest structure for over 3,800 years. Made of around 2.3 million blocks, it used local limestone and imported granite and white limestone. Inside are three chambers, including the King's Chamber with a granite sarcophagus. Hemiunu, Khufu's vizier, is believed to have designed it. The pyramid is part of a larger complex with temples, smaller pyramids, and buried solar boats.",
