	"summary": "Tarantula hawks are large wasps that hunt tarantulas. They belong to the Pompilidae family and are found on every continent except Europe and Antarctica. These wasps sting their prey to paralyze it, then drag the tarantula to a nest as food for their young. They lay an egg on the live tarantula, and the larva feeds on it after hatching.",
