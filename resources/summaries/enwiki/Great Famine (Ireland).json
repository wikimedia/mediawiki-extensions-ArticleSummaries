	"summary": "The Great Famine, also called the Irish Potato Famine, happened in Ireland from 1845 to 1852. It was a very bad time when many people starved and got sick because the potato crops were ruined by a disease. Over one million people died, and another million left Ireland to find a better life. This event changed Ireland a lot, making many people leave and causing trouble between Ireland and Britain. It also made the Irish more determined to fight for their independence. The famine's effects were so big that they are still remembered and talked about today.",
