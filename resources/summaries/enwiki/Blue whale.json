	"summary": "The blue whale is the biggest animal ever! It can grow up to 98 feet long and weigh nearly 200 tons. These marine mammals have a slim, blue-gray body and live in oceans worldwide. They mainly eat tiny shrimp-like creatures called krill. Blue whales often live alone or in small groups and make low-frequency sounds to communicate.\n\nIn the past, hunters killed many blue whales, but now they are protected by law. Even though their population is slowly increasing, they are still considered an endangered species due to threats like ship collisions and pollution.",
