It's a hybrid of cabbage and turnip and has many names, like Swedish turnip or neep. People eat the roots and leaves, and it's popular in Scotland, England, Wales, Ireland, and the Isle of Man. In these places, people also use rutabagas to make Jack-o'-lanterns for Halloween. Farmers feed the roots and leaves to livestock too.",
