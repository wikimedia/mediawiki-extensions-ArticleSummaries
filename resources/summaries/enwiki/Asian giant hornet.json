	"summary": "The Asian giant hornet is the world's largest hornet, found in East and South Asia, and parts of Russia. It was spotted in North America in 2019, but by 2022, there were no confirmed sightings, suggesting it might have been eradicated there. These hornets live in low mountains and forests, feeding on large insects, other social insects' colonies, tree sap, and honey. They have a body length of about 1.75 inches, a wingspan of around 3 inches, and a quarter-inch-long stinger that delivers powerful venom.",
