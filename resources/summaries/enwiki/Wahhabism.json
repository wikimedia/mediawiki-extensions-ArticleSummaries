	"summary": "Wahhabism is a religious movement within Sunni Islam, started by Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab in the 1700s. It began in Arabia and is mostly followed in Saudi Arabia and Qatar today. Wahhabism wanted to get rid of traditions that were not part of Islam's early teachings. They opposed visiting saint tombs and believed in a pure form of worship.\n\nThis movement was like a revolution, going against the Turkish and Persian empires. It inspired people across the Islamic world to fight against colonial rule. Wahhabism has been important in Saudi Arabia's history, but recent changes are moving the country away from this religious tradition.",
