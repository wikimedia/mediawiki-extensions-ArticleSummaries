	"summary": "The Ainu are an Indigenous group native to northern Japan and nearby areas like Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands. They have lived in these regions, known as \"Ainu Mosir,\" since ancient times. The Ainu population is estimated to be around 25,000 in Japan, but some believe it could be much higher due to many people being unaware of their Ainu ancestry.\n\nHistorically, the Ainu faced forced assimilation and discrimination by the Japanese government. They were pushed off their lands, forbidden to practice their culture and language, and forced to adopt Japanese customs. This led to a decline in the Ainu language and traditional ways of life. Recently, there have been efforts to revive the Ainu culture and language.",
