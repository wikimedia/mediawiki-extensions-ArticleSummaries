	"summary": "The Sengoku Period in Japan was a time of constant civil war and social chaos from the 15th to 16th centuries. It began with events like the Kyōtoku Incident in 1454 and ended around 1638, overlapping with the Muromachi Period. This era saw powerful local lords, called *sengoku daimyo*, rise up against the central government. Samurai rules changed, allowing people from different social classes to become warriors. Three famous leaders—Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and Tokugawa Ieyasu—are known as the \"Great Unifiers\" for bringing Japan back under central rule.",
