	"summary": "Scorpions are eight-legged arachnids with pincers and a curved, segmented tail with a stinger. They've existed for 435 million years and live everywhere except Antarctica. There are over 2,500 species, and most aren't dangerous to humans. Scorpions eat insects and sometimes vertebrates. They use their pincers to catch prey and their sting for defense. Females give birth to live young and carry them on their backs. Scorpions are often seen in art, folklore, and astrology, symbolizing protection and power.",
