	"summary": "The Ethiopian Empire was a powerful state in Africa, lasting from around 1270 to 1974. It was founded by Yekuno Amlak, who claimed descent from ancient kings. The empire expanded under rulers like Menelik II, reaching its peak under Emperor Zara Yaqob. It faced threats from Muslim neighbors but repelled Ottoman invasions. After a period of decentralization, Emperor Tewodros II restored central power. Menelik II unified Ethiopia's modern boundaries and defeated Italian forces at the Battle of Adwa. Italy later occupied Ethiopia during World War II, but the empire was restored. It ended in 1974 due to famine and political unrest.",
