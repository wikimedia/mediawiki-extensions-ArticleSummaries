	"summary": "The multiverse is a mind-bending idea that suggests there are countless universes besides our own. These parallel universes might have different rules and look very different from our own. Scientists have debated this concept for a long time, with some believing it's a useful idea and others arguing it's not scientific enough.\n\nMax Tegmark and Brian Greene have created ways to categorize these universes, like different levels of reality or types of multiverses. The anthropic principle suggests that the multiverse could explain why our universe seems perfectly suited for life. However, many questions remain, and some scientists think we should stick to studying our universe for now.",
