	"summary": "Anarchism is a political idea that wants to get rid of all leaders and rules that aren't needed. Anarchists believe people should work together without a government or big businesses. They think everyone should be free and equal.\n\nThis idea started during the Enlightenment and became popular in the 1800s and 1900s, with anarchists helping workers fight for their rights. They even tried to take over during some big events, like the Spanish Civil War.\n\nToday, anarchism is still around, with people using different methods to try and create a more fair world. Some do this slowly, while others want to make big, quick changes.",
