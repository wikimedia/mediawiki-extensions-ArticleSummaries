	"summary": "The labia are the main visible parts of the vulva. There are two pairs: the labia majora (outer lips) and labia minora (inner lips). The majora are larger and cover the other parts, while the minora are thinner and protect the urethra, vagina, and clitoris. When the majora are pulled aside, the minora become more visible. In other mammals, only the minora are present and are called labia vulvae.",
