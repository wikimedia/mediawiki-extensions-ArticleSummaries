	"summary": "Baroque is an art style that was popular in the 1600s and 1700s. It was used in many types of art, like architecture, music, and painting. The Catholic Church liked it because it was fancy and detailed, unlike the simple Protestant art. It started in Rome and spread across Europe, with each country adding its own unique touch. Baroque art is known for its bright colors, movement, and surprise elements, making people feel amazed. Over time, it changed into an even more colorful style called Rococo.",
