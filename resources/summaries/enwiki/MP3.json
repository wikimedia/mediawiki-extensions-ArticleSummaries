	"summary": "MP3 is a digital audio format that helps reduce the size of audio files while keeping the sound quality good enough for most listeners. It was developed in Germany by the Fraunhofer Society. MP3 files can be up to 95% smaller than original digital audio files, like those on a CD. This format became very popular for sharing music online in the late 1990s because of its small size. Today, MP3 is a standard way to store and play music on many devices, including smartphones.",
