	"summary": "Battleships are massive warships known for their powerful guns and thick armor. They were the most feared ships in the late 1800s and early 1900s, with countries racing to build the biggest and best. The HMS Dreadnought, launched in 1906, changed battleship design forever.\n\nThese ships ruled the oceans until aircraft carriers took over in World War II. Despite their size and strength, battleships were vulnerable to smaller weapons like torpedoes and later, aircraft. Today, many old battleships are museum ships, reminding us of their past glory.",
