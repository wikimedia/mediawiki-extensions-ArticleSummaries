	"summary": "Doggy style is a sex position where one person bends over or gets on all fours, while the other partner enters from behind. It's a type of rear-entry position, and though not the most common, it's often a favorite for men. In this position, the person in front is usually more passive, while the partner behind is active. However, roles can be reversed, and either person can be dominant or submissive.",
