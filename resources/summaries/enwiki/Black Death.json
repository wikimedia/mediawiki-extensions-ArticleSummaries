The plague was caused by a bacterium called Yersinia pestis, spread by fleas and through the air. It started in Central Asia and reached Europe through trade routes. The disease changed Europe's history, causing big social and economic problems. It took Europe a long time to recover, and the plague kept coming back until the 19th century.",
