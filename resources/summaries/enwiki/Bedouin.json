	"summary": "Bedouins are nomadic Arab tribes who live in deserts across the Middle East and North Africa. They are known for their traditional way of life, herding camels, sheep, and goats. Most Bedouins are Muslim. The term 'Bedouin' comes from the Arabic word for \"desert-dweller.\"\n\nHistorically, they have been called different names, like 'Arabaa' by the Assyrians. Many Bedouins have moved to cities and adopted modern lifestyles, but some still keep their cultural traditions, like clan structures, music, and poetry. They often organize festivals to celebrate and share their heritage.",
