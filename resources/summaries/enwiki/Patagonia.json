	"summary": "Patagonia is a region at the southern tip of South America, shared by Argentina and Chile. It's known for its diverse landscapes: mountains, lakes, forests, and glaciers in the west, and deserts and steppes in the east. The Pacific and Atlantic Oceans border it. Rivers like the Colorado mark its northern edge in Argentina, while in Chile, it's the Huincul Fault.\n\nBefore the Spanish arrived, indigenous tribes lived there, some farming in the northwest. Over time, Argentina and Chile colonized the area, leading to a decline in indigenous populations and an influx of European settlers. Today, Patagonia's economy includes sheep farming, oil production, fishing, and tourism.",
