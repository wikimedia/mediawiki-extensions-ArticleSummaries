It's vital for Egypt, Sudan, and South Sudan, providing water for agriculture and fishing. The Nile has two main branches: the White Nile, which starts at Lake Victoria, and the Blue Nile, originating from Lake Tana in Ethiopia. These tributaries meet in Sudan, forming the Nile that continues north through Egypt. Ancient civilizations relied on the Nile's annual floods. Today, it remains crucial for Egypt's population and historical sites.",
