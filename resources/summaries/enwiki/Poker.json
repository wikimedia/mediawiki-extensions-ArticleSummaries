	"summary": "Poker is a card game where players bet on who has the best hand. It's played with a deck of 52 cards, but sometimes with fewer. The game starts with players putting money into the pot, then they take turns betting, calling, or folding. If everyone folds except one player, that player wins the pot. If not, the players reveal their hands, and the best hand wins. Poker has become very popular, with big tournaments and professional players. It's a game of chance, but also skill, strategy, and psychology.",
