	"summary": "Anglicanism is a Christian tradition that started in England during the Protestant Reformation. It's one of the biggest Christian groups, with over 110 million followers worldwide. Anglicans believe in the Bible, church traditions, and the teachings of early Christian leaders. They follow the Archbishop of Canterbury, who leads the Anglican Communion, a global network of churches.\n\nAnglicanism is known for finding a balance between different Christian beliefs. It has its own prayer book, called the *Book of Common Prayer*, used for worship. After the American Revolution, Anglican churches in the U.S. and Canada became independent, and the tradition spread to other countries through British missions.",
