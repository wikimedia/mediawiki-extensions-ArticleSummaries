	"summary": "An extinction event, or mass extinction, is when many different types of living things suddenly disappear from Earth. This happens when the rate of extinction goes up faster than the rate of new species forming. Scientists think there have been at least five big mass extinctions in the last 540 million years, but some think there might have been more. It's hard to agree on the exact number because it's tricky to measure how diverse life was in the past.",
