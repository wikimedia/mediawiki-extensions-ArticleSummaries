	"summary": "In 1906, the British Royal Navy launched HMS Dreadnought, a powerful new battleship. Its design was so impressive that similar ships after it were called \"dreadnoughts.\" These ships had huge guns and powerful engines, starting a new naval arms race. The term \"dreadnought\" became famous, but most were scrapped after World War I. Only one, USS Texas, remains today as a museum ship. Despite their importance, dreadnoughts only fought once in a big battle, at Jutland in 1916.",
