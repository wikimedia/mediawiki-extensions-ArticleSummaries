	"summary": "Paracetamol, also known as acetaminophen, is a medicine used to treat pain and fever. It's a popular over-the-counter drug, often found in brands like Tylenol and Panadol. This drug can help with mild headaches and post-surgery pain but is not as strong as ibuprofen for fever.\n\nWhile safe for short-term use, taking too much paracetamol can cause liver problems. The right dose is important; adults should take no more than 3-4 grams daily. It was discovered a long time ago, in the 19th century, and is now a very common medicine worldwide.",
