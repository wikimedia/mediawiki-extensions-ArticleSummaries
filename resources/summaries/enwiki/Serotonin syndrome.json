It's usually caused by combining two or more medications like antidepressants or drugs like amphetamines.\n\nDoctors diagnose it by checking your symptoms and medicines. Treatment involves stopping the medicines causing the problem and sometimes using other drugs to help. With quick treatment, most people recover, but it can be life-threatening if not treated.",
