	"summary": "The October Revolution in 1917 was a major event in Russia's history. It was led by Vladimir Lenin's Bolshevik Party and followed the February Revolution earlier that year. After the provisional government, led by Alexander Kerensky, failed to end Russia's involvement in World War I and faced criticism from workers' councils, the Bolsheviks gained support. On November 7, Bolshevik Red Guards took control of government buildings in Petrograd, marking the revolution's peak. This led to the Russian Civil War and eventually the formation of the Soviet Union. The event was seen as a victory for workers by the Soviets but viewed as a totalitarian takeover by Western countries.",
