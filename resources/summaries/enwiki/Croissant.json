	"summary": "A croissant is a French pastry shaped like a crescent moon. It's made with puff pastry and lots of butter, creating a flaky texture. The shape comes from an Austrian pastry called kipferl. Modern croissants were made in the 20th century using yeast-leavened dough. Now, you can find them quickly made from frozen dough in many places, not just bakeries. They're often eaten for breakfast in Europe.",
