	"summary": "Fascism is a far-right political ideology that believes in strong, centralized power and a powerful leader. It started in Europe during World War I, with leaders like Benito Mussolini in Italy and Adolf Hitler in Germany. Fascists support a powerful government that controls many aspects of life, including the economy. They often think violence is okay for national strength and may discriminate against certain groups. After World War II, fascism became less popular, and now few groups openly call themselves fascist. Instead, some modern groups with similar ideas are labeled neo-fascist.",
