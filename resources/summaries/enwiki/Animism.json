	"summary": "Animism is the belief that everything, from animals and plants to rocks and rivers, has a spirit or soul. It means that these things are alive and have their own will. This idea is found in many ancient cultures and Indigenous communities worldwide. The term \"animism\" was made up by scientists who study different cultures to describe these beliefs. Some people think it's a basic way of thinking about the world, while others see it as a religion. Animism shows that nature is full of spirits and life forces, even in things like words and names.",
