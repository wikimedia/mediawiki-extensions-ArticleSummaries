	"summary": "Dogs, or *Canis familiaris*, are our beloved pets and loyal companions. They are descendants of wolves, domesticated over 14,000 years ago by ancient hunters. Dogs were the first animals tamed by humans and have since become a vital part of our lives.\n\nBreeds vary in size, shape, and color, but all share similar traits: strong jaws, sharp senses, and a unique bond with humans. They communicate through body language, sounds, and scent marking. Dogs help us in many ways, from hunting and herding to providing emotional support and assisting in police and military work.\n\nToday, dogs are the most common pets in the U.S., living in millions of homes worldwide.",
