There are 21 different species, varying in size from the tiny 5-inch pink fairy armadillo to the giant armadillo, which can be nearly 5 feet long and weigh over 100 pounds. Some can even roll into a ball for protection. Armadillos are related to anteaters and sloths, and ancient relatives, the glyptodonts, were huge and looked like giant armadillos.",
