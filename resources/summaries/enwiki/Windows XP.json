XP means \"experience,\" and it offered better performance, stability, and an easier-to-use design. It was the first Windows version not based on older technology, and it only works on specific computer parts. Support for Windows XP ended in 2014, but some people still use it, even though Microsoft discourages this due to potential problems.",
