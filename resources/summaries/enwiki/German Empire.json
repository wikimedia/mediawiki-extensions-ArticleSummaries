	"summary": "The German Empire was a powerful nation in Europe that existed from 1871 to 1918. It was formed when many German states united, with Prussia as the leading state. Otto von Bismarck was the first chancellor, guiding Germany through industrialization and scientific advancements. Germany became the largest economy in continental Europe and a great power with a strong army and navy.\n\nBismarck's policies included social reforms and anti-Catholic measures. Later, under Wilhelm II, Germany pursued an aggressive foreign policy, known as Weltpolitik, which led to tensions with other countries. This ultimately contributed to the start of World War I, which Germany lost, resulting in its collapse and the establishment of a republic.",
