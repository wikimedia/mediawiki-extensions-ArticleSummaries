	"summary": "Yeast are tiny, single-celled fungi. They've existed for millions of years and there are over 1,500 known species. Yeasts can be really small, about 3-4 micrometers, but some can grow to 40 micrometers. Most reproduce by a process called budding.\n\nOne important type is *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, used in baking and making alcohol. It's also a key tool for scientists studying cells. Other yeasts, like *Candida albicans*, can cause infections.\n\nNot all fungi called \"yeast\" are related. Some are in the Ascomycota group, others in Basidiomycota.",
