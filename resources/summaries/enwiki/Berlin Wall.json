	"summary": "The Berlin Wall was a big concrete barrier that separated East and West Berlin from 1961 to 1989. East Germany built it to stop people from leaving the country. It had guard towers and a wide area with trenches and other defenses. People called it the \"Wall of Shame\" because it restricted freedom.\n\nMany tried to escape over the Wall, but it was dangerous, and East German authorities stopped most attempts. In 1989, after changes in other communist countries, the Wall was opened, and people celebrated. Germany reunited soon after.",
