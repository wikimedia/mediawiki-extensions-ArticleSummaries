	"summary": "The Al-Aqsa Mosque is the main prayer hall in the Old City of Jerusalem. It's part of a larger area called Al-Aqsa Mosque Compound, also known as the Noble Sanctuary. The mosque was first built during the rule of Islamic caliphs in the 7th century. It has been destroyed and rebuilt several times due to earthquakes and other events. After the Crusaders captured it, the mosque was used as a palace, but it was restored as a mosque when Saladin took over in 1187. Over the centuries, different rulers made additions and repairs. Today, it is administered by the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf.",
