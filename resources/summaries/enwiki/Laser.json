	"summary": "Lasers are devices that create powerful, focused light beams. They work by amplifying light through a process called stimulated emission. The first laser was made in 1960. Lasers are special because their light is coherent, meaning it stays narrow and focused over long distances.\n\nLasers are used in many ways, like cutting materials, reading DVDs, printing, and even in some car headlights. They're also used in medicine, like for surgery and skin treatments.",
