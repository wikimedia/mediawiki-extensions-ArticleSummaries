	"summary": "This list ranks the most populous cities in the United States. It includes cities, towns, and some special areas defined by the Census Bureau. Consolidated city-counties, which combine city and county governments, are also included, but only the parts that aren't part of another city. The list only counts people living within city limits, not suburbs or rural areas. So, the rankings might change if you consider urban or metropolitan areas.",
