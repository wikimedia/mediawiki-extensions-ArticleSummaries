	"summary": "The Voyager Golden Records are special messages sent into space on two Voyager spacecraft. Launched in 1977, these records hold sounds and pictures from Earth, meant to introduce our planet's life and culture to possible alien civilizations. It's like a time capsule traveling through space. Even though the Voyagers aren't aimed at any specific star, one will get close to a star called Gliese 445 in about 40,000 years. Carl Sagan saw this mission as a hopeful sign of Earth's life and ambition.",
