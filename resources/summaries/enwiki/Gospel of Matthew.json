	"summary": "The Gospel of Matthew, an important book in the Bible, tells the story of Jesus, the Jewish Messiah. It explains how Jesus came to his people, the Jews, but they didn't accept him. After his resurrection, Jesus asked his followers to share his message with non-Jews (gentiles).\n\nMatthew wanted to make sure that the Jewish traditions were not forgotten as more gentiles joined the early Christian church. He criticized Jewish leaders, like the scribes and Pharisees, for not believing in Jesus, and claimed that God's kingdom was now given to the church. Many scholars believe this gospel was written by a Jewish author around the year AD 150.",
