	"summary": "Egyptian hieroglyphs were an ancient writing system used in Egypt for thousands of years. They were complex, using many different symbols to represent ideas, sounds, and words. Hieroglyphs were written on papyrus, wood, and stone, and were used for religious texts and important records. Over time, this writing evolved into other scripts, like hieratic and demotic, and even influenced modern alphabets.\n\nThe earliest known hieroglyphic sentence dates back to around 2800 BC. The language was finally deciphered in the 1820s with the help of the Rosetta Stone. Today, we have a vast collection of ancient Egyptian texts, offering insights into their history and culture.",
