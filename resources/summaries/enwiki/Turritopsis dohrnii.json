	"summary": "Turritopsis dohrnii is a unique jellyfish species found in oceans worldwide. It's nicknamed the \"immortal jellyfish\" because it can revert to its younger form, called a polyp, when stressed or sick. This process, called transdifferentiation, allows it to start a new life cycle, making it biologically immortal.\n\nThese jellyfish start as tiny larvae, become polyps, and then grow into mature jellyfish. They can hunt other jellyfish and, if threatened, transform back into polyps. While theoretically immortal, they often fall prey to predators or diseases in their jellyfish stage. This fascinating species is now a focus of aging and medical research.",
