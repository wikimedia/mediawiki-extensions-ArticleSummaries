	"summary": "Gibraltar is a small British territory at the tip of Spain. It's known for its iconic rock and strategic location where the Mediterranean Sea meets the Atlantic Ocean. Originally built as a watchtower in the 1100s, it changed hands many times before becoming British in 1704. Today, Gibraltar is home to around 34,000 people, many of whom speak Spanish. Its economy is strong, with jobs in finance, tourism, and gaming. Despite being British, Gibraltar is not part of the European Union, but it is working to make it easier for people to travel between Gibraltar and Spain.",
