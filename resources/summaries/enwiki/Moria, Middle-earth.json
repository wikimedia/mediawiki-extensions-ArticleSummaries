	"summary": "In J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy world, Moria (also called Khazad-d√ªm) is an old underground city under the Misty Mountains. Once the greatest city of the Dwarves, it was abandoned after they woke a powerful demon, a Balrog, while mining for a valuable metal called mithril. By the time of *The Lord of the Rings*, Moria was dark and dangerous, filled with Orcs and the Balrog. It's featured in Peter Jackson's movies and has inspired many games. Tolkien likely drew inspiration from various myths and legends.",
