	"summary": "Anthropology is a fascinating field of science that explores all aspects of being human. It looks at how we behave, our biology, culture, society, and language, both now and in the past. There are different types of anthropology, like social anthropology, which focuses on our actions and patterns, and cultural anthropology, which examines our beliefs and values. Linguistic anthropology studies the power of language, while biological anthropology investigates our physical development. Archaeology, often linked to anthropology, digs up clues from the past to understand ancient human activities.",
