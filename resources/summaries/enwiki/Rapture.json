	"summary": "The Rapture is a belief held by some American evangelical Christians. It describes a future event where all Christian believers, both living and dead, will rise up to meet Jesus in the sky. This idea comes from a Bible verse in 1 Thessalonians, using the Greek word *harpazo*, meaning \"to snatch away.\"\n\nSome Christians think this will happen before a time of trouble, called the Tribulation. However, many Christian churches don't believe in this doctrine and have different interpretations of the Bible's end-time events.",
