	"summary": "Halley's Comet is a special comet that we can see from Earth every 75-80 years. It's named after Edmond Halley, who realized it was the same comet coming back. It last visited in 1986 and will return in 2061.\n\nIn 1986, spaceships got close to Halley, showing us it's like a 'dirty snowball' - a mix of ice and dust. We learned that its surface is mostly dusty, not icy. This famous comet has been seen for over 2000 years!",
