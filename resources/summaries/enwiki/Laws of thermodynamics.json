	"summary": "The laws of thermodynamics are like rules for understanding how energy and heat work in different systems. There are four main laws, numbered zero to three. These laws explain how temperature, energy, and entropy (a measure of disorder) are related.\n\nThe zeroth law defines thermal equilibrium, where two systems with the same temperature won't exchange heat. The first law says energy can't be created or destroyed, only changed. The second law states that in natural processes, entropy always increases, and heat doesn't move from cold to hot by itself. The third law tells us that as temperature drops to absolute zero, entropy also gets very close to zero.",
