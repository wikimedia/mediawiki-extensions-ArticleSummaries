	"summary": "Appalachia is a region in the eastern U.S., covering parts of 13 states, mostly in the Appalachian Mountains. It has a population of around 26.3 million, mainly white residents. Historically, Appalachia has been misunderstood, with stereotypes portraying its people as uneducated. These ideas are untrue and have been challenged by sociologists.\n\nThe area is rich in natural resources but has faced economic challenges. Logging and coal mining brought jobs but not long-term prosperity. Government initiatives like the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and the Appalachian Regional Commission helped combat poverty by providing electricity, improving infrastructure, and supporting education and healthcare. Today, Appalachia's economy is improving but still lags behind the national average.",
