	"summary": "The Epic of Gilgamesh is an ancient story from Mesopotamia about a powerful king named Gilgamesh. It started as separate Sumerian poems about 4,000 years ago and was later combined into an epic. The story tells of Gilgamesh's friend Enkidu, who was sent by the gods to stop Gilgamesh from mistreating his people. Together, they go on adventures, including a trip to a magical forest. After Enkidu dies, Gilgamesh goes on a quest to find eternal life but learns that death is part of being human. This epic inspired many other hero stories, like those of Heracles.",
