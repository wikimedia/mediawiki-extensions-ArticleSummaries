	"summary": "Rhabdomyolysis is when your muscles get hurt and break down quickly, often from intense exercise. You might feel muscle pain, weakness, and even get confused. It can also cause dark urine and kidney problems.\n\nThings like hard exercise, injuries, some medicines, or even being immobile for too long can cause it. Doctors might use blood and urine tests to diagnose it.\n\nTreatment includes lots of fluids and sometimes dialysis. If caught early, most people recover well. It's a serious condition, affecting around 26,000 people in the U.S. each year, often after disasters like earthquakes.",
