	"summary": "The Vasa was a Swedish warship built in the 1600s. It sank on its first voyage in 1628 because it was top-heavy and unstable. The ship was forgotten until it was found again in the 1950s. It was salvaged and is now a famous museum piece in Stockholm. Over 45 million people have visited it since 1961. The Vasa provides a unique look at 17th-century Swedish life and naval warfare. Many artifacts, like clothes, weapons, and even food, were found inside.",
