	"summary": "## The Federal Reserve: A Simple Explanation\n\nThe Federal Reserve, or Fed, is the U.S. central bank. Created in 1913 after several financial crises, it's like a boss for money. Its big jobs are to keep employment high, prices stable, and interest rates reasonable.\n\nThe Fed controls money by raising or lowering interest rates. It also watches over banks and helps keep the whole financial system stable. Think of it as a money traffic cop, making sure everything runs smoothly.\n\nIt's made up of a board of governors and 12 regional banks spread across the country. While it works independently from the government, it still has to answer to Congress.",
