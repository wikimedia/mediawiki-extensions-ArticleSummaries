	"summary": "Jersey is an island country in Europe, a British territory near France. It's the biggest of the Channel Islands and has its own government and laws. Originally part of Normandy, it stayed loyal to England when Normandy was lost. During World War II, Nazi Germany occupied Jersey, but it was liberated in 1945. Today, Jersey has a strong economy, with many financial services. It's culturally similar to Britain, using English and the pound sterling, but also has a unique Norman-French influence seen in its language, JÃ¨rriais, and French-inspired place names. Jersey is not part of the UK, but the British government handles its defense and international relations.",
