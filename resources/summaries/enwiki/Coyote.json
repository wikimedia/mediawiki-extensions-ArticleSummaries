	"summary": "The coyote is a North American canine, smaller than a wolf. It's versatile and can live in cities. With 19 subspecies, it weighs between 18 to 44 pounds. Coyotes are gray-red with black and white patches. They live in packs or families and eat meat, sometimes fruit. They howl to communicate.\n\nCoyotes are clever and can trick other animals. In Native American stories, they are often tricksters. However, in Anglo-American culture, coyotes are seen as sneaky and untrustworthy.",
