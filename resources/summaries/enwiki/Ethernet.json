	"summary": "Ethernet is a technology for connecting computers and devices in networks. It was introduced in the 1980s and has since become very popular, replacing other wired networking methods. Ethernet uses cables, like twisted pairs or fiber optics, to send data quickly between devices. Over time, it has gotten faster, with speeds up to 400 gigabits per second. Ethernet divides data into small parts called frames, which include addresses to ensure the data reaches the right place. It's used in homes, businesses, and the Internet, making it an essential part of modern networking.",
