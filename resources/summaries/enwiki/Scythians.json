	"summary": "The Scythians were ancient nomadic people who lived around 900-300 BC. They came from Central Asia and settled in what is now Ukraine and Russia. Known for their horse-riding skills and warfare, they became powerful in the region. They often raided places in West Asia with the Cimmerians. After facing defeat, they returned to their steppe home. Later, they were taken over by the Sarmatians and eventually mixed with other groups, disappearing by the 3rd century AD. The name 'Scythians' was later used for other steppe people, even if they weren't related.",
