	"summary": "Beavers are big, water-loving rodents found in North America and Europe. They're known for building dams and homes using sticks, rocks, and mud. These structures create special habitats for many other animals. Beavers eat plants and trees, and they have strong teeth to cut through wood. They live in families, with mom, dad, and their babies working together to fix their homes. Beavers were once in danger because of hunting for their fur and a substance they produce, but now their numbers have increased, and they are no longer considered endangered.",
