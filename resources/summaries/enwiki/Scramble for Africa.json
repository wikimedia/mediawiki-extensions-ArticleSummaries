	"summary": "The **Scramble for Africa** was when seven European countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom) took control of most of Africa in the late 1800s and early 1900s. They were driven by industrial growth and wanted resources and power.\n\nIn 1870, only 10% of Africa was under European rule. By 1914, almost 90% was colonized. Only a few areas, like Ethiopia and Liberia, stayed independent. The 1884 Berlin Conference helped organize this takeover.  \n\nAfter World War II, most African countries gained independence and kept the borders the colonists had drawn to avoid conflict.",
