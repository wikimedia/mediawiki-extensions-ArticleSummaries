	"summary": "Snakes are long, legless reptiles found almost everywhere except Antarctica. They have flexible skulls to eat big prey and paired organs in a line due to their slim bodies. Some have tiny claws. There are over 3,900 species, from the tiny 4.1-inch Barbados threadsnake to the 22.8-foot reticulated python. Snakes evolved from lizards during the Jurassic period and diversified after the dinosaur extinction. Most aren't venomous, but some have powerful venom. Nonvenomous snakes either swallow prey whole or constrict it.",
