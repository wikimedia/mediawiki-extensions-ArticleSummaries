	"summary": "Aboriginal Australians are the Indigenous people of mainland Australia and some islands, excluding the Torres Strait Islands. They arrived in Australia over 65,000 years ago and formed many different language-based groups. These groups had unique cultures, beliefs, and connections to their land, known as \"Country.\"\n\nBefore European colonization, they had complex societies, trade networks, and spiritual traditions. Today, Aboriginal people make up 3.8% of Australia's population. Many speak English and live in cities, but they also preserve their traditional languages and cultural practices, like storytelling and art, which are part of the ancient \"Dreaming\" beliefs.",
