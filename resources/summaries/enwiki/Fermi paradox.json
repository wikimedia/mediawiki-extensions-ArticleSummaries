	"summary": "The Fermi Paradox, named after physicist Enrico Fermi, questions why we haven't found evidence of alien life despite its likely existence. In 1950, Fermi wondered aloud, \"Where is everybody?\" during a discussion about UFOs and space travel. The paradox highlights the discrepancy between the vastness of the universe and the lack of contact with extraterrestrial civilizations. Many theories attempt to explain this, such as suggesting aliens are rare, their civilizations are short-lived, or they exist but remain hidden or undetectable to us.",
