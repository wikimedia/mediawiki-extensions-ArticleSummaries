	"summary": "Eastern Europe is a part of the European continent, but its exact boundaries are not clear. It includes countries like Belarus, Russia, Ukraine, and Romania, and sometimes also parts of the Balkans and the Baltic states. The region has a rich culture influenced by the East Slavs, Greeks, and Eastern Christianity. Historically, it was also defined by the Cold War, with Eastern Europe referring to communist countries under Soviet influence. Some people think the term is unfair, as it might suggest these countries are less important than Western Europe.",
