	"summary": "Lupus is an autoimmune disease where the body's immune system attacks healthy tissues. Symptoms include joint pain, fever, rashes, and tiredness. It can affect many body parts and has periods of flares (illness) and remission. The cause is unknown but might be a mix of genetic and environmental factors. Diagnosis is through symptoms and tests. There's no cure, but treatments like medicines and lifestyle changes can help manage symptoms. It's more common in women and certain ethnic groups. The name 'lupus' comes from the Latin word for 'wolf' due to the rash's appearance.",
