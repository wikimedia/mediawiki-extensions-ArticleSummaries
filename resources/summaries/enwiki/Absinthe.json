	"summary": "Absinthe is a strong, anise-flavored spirit made from various plants, including wormwood. It originated in Switzerland in the 1700s and became popular in France, especially among artists. Known for its green color and high alcohol content, it was called \"the green fairy.\" Despite claims of being addictive and harmful, mostly due to a compound called thujone, studies show it's no more dangerous than other spirits. Banned in many places early in the 20th century, absinthe has made a comeback and is now produced and enjoyed worldwide.",
