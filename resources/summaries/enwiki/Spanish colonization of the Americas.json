	"summary": "The Spanish Empire began colonizing the Americas in 1493, led by explorers like Christopher Columbus. They claimed land in the Caribbean, North and South America, except for Brazil, which belonged to Portugal. Many Spanish men and women settled in areas with rich resources and large indigenous populations.\n\nThe Spanish brought Christianity and established religious and civil structures. They also enslaved indigenous people and later Africans, leading to a significant decline in the indigenous population. After independence wars in the 19th century, most of Spanish America became independent nations, while Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines remained under Spanish rule until the Spanish-American War in 1898.",
