	"summary": "The Carboniferous period lasted from about 359 million to 299 million years ago. It's named after the coal-rich rocks formed during this time. This period saw the establishment of both land plants and animals. Amphibians thrived, earning it the nickname \"Age of Amphibians.\" Insects and other land arthropods also diversified. The later part of the Carboniferous featured glaciations and the formation of Pangaea as continents collided. A significant rainforest collapse marked the period's end, but the oxygen levels during this time are still uncertain.",
