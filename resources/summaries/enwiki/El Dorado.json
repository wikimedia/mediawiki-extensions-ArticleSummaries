	"summary": "El Dorado is a famous legend about a golden city in South America. It started with a story about a Muisca tribal chief who covered himself in gold dust and went to a sacred lake. The Spanish called him \"The Golden King\" and believed he lived in a city of gold. Many people, including famous explorers like Sir Walter Raleigh, went on expeditions to find El Dorado in what is now Colombia, Venezuela, and nearby areas. They explored and mapped much of South America, but never found the golden city. Today, most people think El Dorado is just a myth.",
