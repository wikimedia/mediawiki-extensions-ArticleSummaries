	"summary": "The Paralympic Games, or Paralympics, are international sports events for athletes with disabilities. They include Summer and Winter games, held shortly after the Olympic Games. Started in 1948 by British World War II veterans, the Paralympics have grown to include thousands of athletes from many countries. Governed by the International Paralympic Committee, competitions are organized like the Olympics. Athletes compete in different categories based on their type of disability, such as vision impairment or limb deficiency. The Paralympics aim for equality with the Olympics, but there's still a big difference in funding.",
