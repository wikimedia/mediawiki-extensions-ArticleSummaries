At its peak, Mali was the largest empire in West Africa, influencing culture through its language, laws, and customs. It started as a small Mandinka kingdom and grew as the Ghana Empire declined. Mali's power peaked in the 14th century but slowly declined due to neighboring empires' attacks and internal issues. By the 17th century, it had broken into smaller chiefdoms.",
