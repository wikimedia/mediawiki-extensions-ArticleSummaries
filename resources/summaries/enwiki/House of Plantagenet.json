	"summary": "The Plantagenets were a powerful royal family that ruled England for over 300 years, starting in 1154. They came from France and had a big impact on England's history. Under their rule, England changed a lot, with new laws like the Magna Carta that limited the king's power. The Plantagenets also faced challenges, like wars with France and rebellions. Their two branches, Lancaster and York, fought for the throne in the Wars of the Roses. This ended with King Richard III's death in 1485, marking the start of the Tudor dynasty. The Plantagenets' legacy continues as all current British monarchs are their descendants.",
