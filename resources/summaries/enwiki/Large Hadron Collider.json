Built by CERN, it smashes tiny particles together at super-high speeds in a 27-kilometer long tunnel under the Franco-Swiss border. This helps scientists study the fundamental building blocks of the universe. The LHC discovered the Higgs boson particle in 2012. It's currently being upgraded to reach even higher energies.",
