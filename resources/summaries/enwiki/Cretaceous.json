	"summary": "The Cretaceous was the longest period of the Mesozoic Era, lasting about 79 million years. It was named after the Latin word for chalk, as this period has many chalk deposits. The climate was warm, with high sea levels and many shallow seas. Dinosaurs ruled the land, while marine reptiles and ammonites lived in the oceans. Flowering plants appeared and became the dominant plant type. The Cretaceous ended with a mass extinction, likely caused by an asteroid impact, that wiped out non-avian dinosaurs and other species.",
