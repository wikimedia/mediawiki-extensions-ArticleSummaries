	"summary": "Hadith are stories and reports about the Prophet Muhammad's life, words, and actions. They are like ancient texts that Muslims use to learn about their religion and laws. These stories were passed down by people who heard them directly from the Prophet or his close friends.\n\nMuslim scholars collect and study Hadith to understand Islamic teachings better. However, not everyone agrees on their importance. Some Muslims believe only the Quran should be followed, while others think Hadith helps explain it.\n\nWestern experts are cautious about Hadith, as they were written long after Muhammad's time, and some might not be accurate.",
