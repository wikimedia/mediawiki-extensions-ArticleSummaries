	"summary": "Osteoarthritis is a common joint problem, especially as people get older. It happens when the soft tissue in your joints, called cartilage, breaks down, causing pain and stiffness. This can make moving and doing daily tasks hard. It often affects fingers, thumbs, knees, and hips.\n\nThings like old injuries, your genes, and being overweight can make you more likely to get it. Exercise, losing weight, and taking certain medicines can help manage the pain. In severe cases, surgery might be needed to replace the damaged joint.",
