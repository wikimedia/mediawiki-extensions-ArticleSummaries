The term 'Inuit' means 'the people' in their language. They traditionally live in areas like Nunavut, Quebec, Alaska, and Chukotka. Inuit is considered a better term than 'Eskimo,' which some find offensive.\n\nInuit communities are spread across different countries, with unique names for their groups, like Kalaallit in Greenland and IÃ±upiat in Alaska and Russia. They have a rich history and are recognized as distinct Indigenous groups in Canada and Greenland.",
