	"summary": "A Complete Blood Count (CBC) is a common medical test that checks the different parts of your blood, like red and white blood cells, and platelets. It also measures important things like hemoglobin, which carries oxygen in your blood. Doctors use CBC results to see if there are any problems, like anemia or infections.\n\nThe test is usually done by a machine, but sometimes doctors look at the blood under a microscope too. People have been studying and improving these tests since the 1800s, making them faster and more accurate.",
