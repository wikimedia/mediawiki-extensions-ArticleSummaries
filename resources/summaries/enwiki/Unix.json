	"summary": "Unix is a type of computer operating system (OS) that was created in 1969 by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie. It's known for being able to handle multiple tasks and users at the same time. The OS is designed with a simple and modular approach, using tools that work together through a system called \"pipes.\" Unix is unique because it was one of the first OSs written in the C programming language, making it flexible and able to run on many different computer types. Over time, different companies have developed their own versions of Unix.",
