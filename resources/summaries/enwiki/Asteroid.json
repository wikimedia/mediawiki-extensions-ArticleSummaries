	"summary": "Asteroids are small, rocky space objects that orbit the Sun, mostly between Mars and Jupiter. They come in different sizes and compositions, from tiny ones to the dwarf planet Ceres. Asteroids are not comets, though they can sometimes look similar. Most asteroids have stable orbits, taking a few years to circle the Sun.\n\nWe've studied asteroids from Earth and sent spacecraft to explore them up close. Some famous missions include NASA's Dawn and OSIRIS-REx, and Japan's Hayabusa. Scientists are interested in asteroids because they can tell us about the early solar system and also because some could potentially hit Earth, like the one that helped cause the dinosaur extinction. Researchers are even testing ways to change an asteroid's path to prevent future collisions.",
