	"summary": "Rastafari is a religion that started in Jamaica in the 1930s. It's all about an Afrocentric take on the Bible and believing in one God, called Jah. Rastas think highly of Haile Selassie, the former Emperor of Ethiopia, seeing him as a special figure. They use the Ethiopian Royal Standard flag with a lion, and the colors red, gold, and green. Rastafari teaches about standing up for the African diaspora and living a natural life. It began among Jamaican people who felt left out by British colonial rule. Today, you can find Rastas all over the world, with their own unique practices and beliefs.",
