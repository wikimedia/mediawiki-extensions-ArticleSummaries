	"summary": "The Rust Belt is a region in the United States that includes parts of the Northeast, Midwest, and South. It got its name because many industrial cities here suffered economic decline, especially in the steel, auto, and coal industries. This happened mostly from the 1950s onwards. Cities like Detroit, Chicago, and Pittsburgh faced job losses and population drop. The term \"Rust Belt\" is a negative way to describe these struggling areas.\n\nPoliticians often focus on this region due to its important swing states. Recently, the Rust Belt played a significant role in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections.",
