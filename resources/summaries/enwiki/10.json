	"summary": "Ten is a whole number that comes after nine and before eleven. It is a special number because it is the base of the decimal system, which is the way we usually count and write numbers. In this system, each digit's position represents a power of ten, making it easy to represent large numbers. For example, the number 100 means one hundred, or ten to the power of two.",
