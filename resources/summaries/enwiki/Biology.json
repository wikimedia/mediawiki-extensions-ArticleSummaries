	"summary": "Biology is the exciting science of living things. It explores everything from tiny cells and molecules to entire ecosystems. All living organisms share some common features: they are made of cells, they pass on genetic information, they evolve, and they use energy.\n\nBiologists study life in many ways. They might look at single cells, the bodies of plants and animals, or how different species interact. This leads to different areas of biology, like molecular biology, ecology, and evolution. Scientists use experiments and observations to learn about the natural world.\n\nLife on Earth is incredibly diverse, with many unique organisms, all playing a part in their environment.",
