	"summary": "## Judas Iscariot: A Summary\n\nJudas Iscariot was one of Jesus' twelve closest followers, but he betrayed Jesus by kissing him in the Garden of Gethsemane. This act led to Jesus' arrest and crucifixion. \n\nThe Bible doesn't say why Judas betrayed Jesus. Some stories say he was paid with silver coins, others say he was controlled by Satan. After realizing his mistake, Judas returned the money and killed himself.\n\nJudas's actions are seen as very bad in Christian history, but some ancient texts, which most Christians don't agree with, suggest he was following Jesus' secret instructions.",
