	"summary": "The Space Shuttle was a spacecraft used by NASA from 1981 to 2011. It could go to low Earth orbit and was partially reusable. The first test flight was in 1981, and it launched many satellites and space probes. Five shuttles were built: Enterprise, Columbia, Challenger, Discovery, and Atlantis. Two shuttles, Challenger and Columbia, crashed, and 14 astronauts died. A new shuttle, Endeavour, was built to replace Challenger. The shuttles launched from Florida and landed like planes. After the shuttles retired, the U.S. used Russian spacecraft to go to the International Space Station until 2020.",
