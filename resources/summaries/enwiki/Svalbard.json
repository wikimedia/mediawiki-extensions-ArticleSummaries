Now, it's a unique place with a mix of mining, research, and tourism. The largest island is Spitsbergen, and Longyearbyen is the main town. The Svalbard Treaty made it a free economic zone under Norwegian rule.\n\nThe archipelago has stunning nature, with glaciers, mountains, and fjords. It's home to special wildlife like polar bears and reindeer. Many areas are protected as national parks or nature reserves. Getting around is done by snowmobile, plane, or boat, as there are no roads between settlements.",
