	"summary": "Moai are giant stone statues of people made by the Rapa Nui on Easter Island between 1250 and 1500. They have big heads and no legs. Many were moved from the quarry to stand on platforms around the island. By the 1800s, all the moai had fallen over, maybe because of wars or contact with Europeans. There are over 900 moai, the tallest being 10 meters high and weighing 82 tons. The heaviest moai weighs 86 tons. Some statues are still being found today.",
