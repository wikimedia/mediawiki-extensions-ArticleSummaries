	"summary": "Neoconservatism is a political idea that started in the U.S. in the 1960s. It came from people who were once liberal but got tired of the Democratic Party's peaceful ways and the counterculture of the time. These \"neocons\" believe in using military power to spread democracy and stop communism. They had a big say in U.S. foreign policy, especially under President George W. Bush, who wanted to make the world safer for America and its allies. Some famous neocons in his government were Paul Wolfowitz and Richard Perle.",
