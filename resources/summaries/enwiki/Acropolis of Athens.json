	"summary": "The Acropolis of Athens is an ancient fortress on a hill above the city. It holds important historical buildings, with the Parthenon being the most famous. The word \"Acropolis\" means the highest point of a city in Greek. This place was also called Cecropia in ancient times. Pericles led the construction of many of the buildings we see today, like the Parthenon, during the 5th century BC. Unfortunately, some structures were damaged in a 17th-century siege when gunpowder stored in the Parthenon exploded.",
