	"summary": "Geometry is a math branch studying shapes, sizes, and spaces. It comes from ancient Greek words meaning \"earth measurement.\" Geometry is very old, and until the 19th century, it mostly focused on Euclidean geometry, which deals with points, lines, and planes.\n\nGeometry is useful in many fields, like science, art, and architecture. It has expanded a lot, with new areas like differential and algebraic geometry. These explore different types of spaces and shapes, even those that don't follow the usual rules of Euclidean geometry.",
