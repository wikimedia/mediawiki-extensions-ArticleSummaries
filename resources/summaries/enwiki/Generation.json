	"summary": "A generation is a group of people born around the same time, usually 20 to 30 years apart. It can refer to family relationships (like parents and children) or social groups that share similar experiences and events. The term is often used in sociology to study how different age groups think and behave. Some experts think generations are crucial in understanding society, while others focus more on factors like class, gender, and race. For example, a baby, its mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother represent four generations of a family.",
