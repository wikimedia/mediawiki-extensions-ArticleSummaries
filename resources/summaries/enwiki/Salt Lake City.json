	"summary": "Salt Lake City, often called SLC, is the capital and biggest city of Utah. It's where many people from the LDS Church settled in 1847 to escape persecution. They made a plan for the city with a grid system. The city has grown a lot since then and now has a big economy thanks to tourism, skiing, and history. It's also a major banking center. Salt Lake City has faced some problems lately, like a drought that's lowered the water level of the Great Salt Lake and made dust with arsenic. There's also a risk of earthquakes because of nearby faults.",
