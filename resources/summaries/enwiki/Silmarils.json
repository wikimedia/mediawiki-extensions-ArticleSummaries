	"summary": "The Silmarils are three precious jewels created by the Elf Fëanor in J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy world. They shine with the pure light of the Two Trees of Valinor. The Silmarillion tells the story of their importance in the creation of the universe and the history of Elves, Dwarves, and Men.\n\nThese jewels are linked to various legends, like the Sampo from Finnish mythology and the Holy Grail. They represent the Elves' pride in their craftsmanship and the desire for knowledge, similar to the Bible's Garden of Eden story. The Silmarils' light is eventually scattered across the Earth, Sea, and Sky, with one becoming Eärendil's Star.",
