	"summary": "A supermoon happens when the full or new moon aligns with the point in its orbit closest to Earth, called perigee. This makes the moon appear slightly larger in the sky. It's called a supermoon because it seems super big! This event has no scientific definition and originated from astrology. Some people believe supermoons can cause natural disasters, but there's no scientific evidence to support this. The opposite of a supermoon is a micromoon, which happens when the moon is at its farthest point from Earth.",
