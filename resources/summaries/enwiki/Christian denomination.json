	"summary": "A Christian denomination is like a unique group or club within Christianity, with its own name, beliefs, and way of worshipping. These groups are part of the larger Christian religion but have different ideas about important things like Jesus, church leadership, and how to interpret the Bible.\n\nThere are many denominations, like Catholic, Protestant, and Orthodox, each with their own history and traditions. Some believe they are the original true church, while others think all Christian groups are valid. These differences mean not all denominations agree or worship together.",
