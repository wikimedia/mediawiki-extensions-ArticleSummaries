	"summary": "Roguelike games are a type of role-playing game where players explore dungeons with levels that are created randomly each time you play.  You move your character on a grid, turn by turn. If your character dies, you have to start over from the beginning - there are no second chances! Most of these games have fantasy themes, like dragons and magic, and were inspired by old games like Rogue and NetHack.  Newer games like Spelunky and Hades are also considered roguelikes because they use random levels and permanent death, even though they might look and play differently.",
