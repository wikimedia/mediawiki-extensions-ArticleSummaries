	"summary": "The LGBTQ community represents people with diverse sexualities, romantic attractions, and gender identities. It stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (or questioning) individuals. The term has evolved over time, starting with \"LGB\" in the 1990s and expanding to \"LGBT\" as transgender acceptance grew. Recently, \"LGBTQ\" and other variations like \"LGBTQIA+\" have been used to be more inclusive. These terms aim to unite various groups under one umbrella, though some people may prefer different labels or not identify with any label at all.",
