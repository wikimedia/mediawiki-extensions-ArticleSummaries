	"summary": "Amazons were powerful female warriors in ancient Greek myths. They lived in a remote land, often said to be near the Black Sea, and were known for their bravery and independence. Led by their queen, they went on military campaigns and founded cities like Ephesos. They were skilled in combat, riding, and archery.\n\nSome believe the myth was inspired by real female warriors found in ancient burial sites. These discoveries suggest that the Amazons might have been based on powerful women from ancient horse cultures like the Scythians and Hittites.",
