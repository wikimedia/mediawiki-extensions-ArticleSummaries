	"summary": "## Koalas: Australia's Cuddly Marsupials\n\nKoalas are tree-dwelling, herbivore marsupials native to Australia. They're known for their fluffy ears, big noses, and love of eucalyptus leaves. Though they look like bears, they're actually related to wombats. Koalas are solitary and sleep a lot, up to 20 hours a day!  They have joeys, or babies, that live in their mom's pouch.\n\nKoalas are important symbols of Australia but are now endangered due to habitat loss, droughts, and bushfires.",
