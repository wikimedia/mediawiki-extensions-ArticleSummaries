	"summary": "A parsec is a unit of measurement used in astronomy to calculate vast distances in space, especially outside our solar system. It is equal to about 3.26 light-years or 30.9 trillion kilometers. The term 'parsec' comes from \"parallax of one second\" and was introduced in 1913. It helps astronomers determine how far away stars and galaxies are. For instance, the nearest star, Proxima Centauri, is around 1.3 parsecs from the Sun. Parsecs are preferred in scientific work, while light-years are more common in popular culture.",
