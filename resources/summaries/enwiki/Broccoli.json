	"summary": "Broccoli is a green vegetable with a unique tree-like shape. It's part of the cabbage family and has large, dark green flower heads (florets) and a thick, light green stalk. You can eat it raw or cooked. Broccoli is very healthy, packed with vitamins C and K, and compounds that help your body fight disease. However, boiling can reduce these benefits, so steaming or stir-frying is better. Don't confuse it with rapini, a smaller, similar-looking vegetable that's actually a type of turnip.",
