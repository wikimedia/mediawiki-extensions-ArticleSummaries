	"summary": "The \"demon core\" was a special ball of plutonium made during World War II to be used in atomic bombs. It was involved in two serious accidents at a lab in New Mexico. In both accidents, scientists accidentally made the core go critical, releasing lots of radiation. Two scientists got very sick and died, and others were also exposed. These accidents taught scientists about the dangers of working with nuclear materials. After the accidents, the core was melted down and used to make new ones.",
