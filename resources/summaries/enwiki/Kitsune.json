	"summary": "In Japanese folklore, kitsune are magical foxes that gain supernatural powers as they age. They can shapeshift, often into humans, and trick people, but they can also be loyal guardians and friends. Kitsune are linked to Inari, a Shinto spirit, and are considered their messengers. The number of tails a kitsune has (up to nine) represents its age, wisdom, and power. Due to their potential influence, some people worship them.",
