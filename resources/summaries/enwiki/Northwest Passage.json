	"summary": "The Northwest Passage is a sea route through the Arctic Ocean, connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. It runs along Canada's north coast and through the Arctic Archipelago. For a long time, explorers wanted to find this route to Asia, but it was very icy and hard to navigate. Recently, with less ice due to climate change, it has become more accessible. However, there are disputes about who controls this area, with Canada claiming it as their internal waters and the US saying it's an international strait. There's also a question about whether the passage is deep enough for large ships.",
