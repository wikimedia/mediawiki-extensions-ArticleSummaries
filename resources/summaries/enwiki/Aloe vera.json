	"summary": "Aloe vera is a popular plant with fleshy leaves that grows in hot, dry places. It's used in many beauty products like lotions and gels because its leaves have a soothing gel inside. This gel can help with small injuries like burns and insect bites. However, you should be careful because aloe vera can be toxic if taken orally, especially for pregnant women. The plant is also attractive, so people often keep it as a houseplant.",
