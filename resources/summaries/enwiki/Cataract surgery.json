	"summary": "Cataract surgery is a procedure to remove a cloudy eye lens, called a cataract, which can cause vision loss. The natural lens is replaced with an artificial one. Cataracts form due to age or sometimes from birth. Symptoms include seeing halos around lights and poor vision in low light.\n\nDuring surgery, the doctor removes the cloudy lens and inserts a new, clear artificial lens. This surgery is usually quick, painless, and done as an outpatient procedure. Most people recover in about a month and regain their vision. It's a common and safe operation with a high success rate.",
