	"summary": "Polyester is a type of plastic made of long chains of molecules. It can be natural, like in plants, or synthetic, created in labs. The most common kind is polyethylene terephthalate (PET), often used in clothes and bottles. Polyester is strong, wrinkle-resistant, and doesn't shrink much. It's also water- and wind-resistant but can melt if it catches fire. Some special polyesters are used in jet engines because they can handle high heat.",
