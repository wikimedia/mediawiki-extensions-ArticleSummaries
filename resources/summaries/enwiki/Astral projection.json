	"summary": "Astral projection is the belief in traveling outside your physical body to explore a spiritual world. It's like having a dream, but you're aware that you're out of your body. People have talked about this idea for thousands of years in many different cultures. Some use meditation or self-hypnosis to try and make it happen. However, scientists haven't found any proof that it's real, so many consider it a pseudoscience.",
