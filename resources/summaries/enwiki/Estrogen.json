	"summary": "Estrogen is a type of hormone that controls the female body's reproductive system and physical traits like breast development. There are three main types, with estradiol being the strongest. Estrogen is found in both males and females, though at lower levels in males. It works by attaching to special receptors in cells, which can change how certain genes work. Estrogen is also used in medicines like hormone therapy for menopausal women and transgender individuals. However, artificial estrogens in the environment can cause health problems for both people and animals.",
