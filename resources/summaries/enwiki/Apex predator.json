	"summary": "## Apex Predators: Top of the Food Chain\n\nApex predators are animals at the very top of the food chain. They have no natural enemies and hunt other animals, even big ones. Examples include lions, saltwater crocodiles, great white sharks, and orcas (killer whales). These predators help keep ecosystems balanced. Humans have long interacted with them, traditionally for hunting, and now also through ecotourism and conservation efforts. Some apex predators, like the Iberian lynx, are being reintroduced to help restore their habitats.",
