	"summary": "Paganism is a term used to describe ancient religions that were not Christian, especially in the Roman Empire. It often refers to polytheistic beliefs, where people worship multiple gods. The word 'pagan' comes from a Latin word meaning 'rural' or 'civilian.' Christians used it to distinguish themselves from those with different faiths.\n\nOver time, the term expanded to include any non-Christian religion. Modern pagans, including those in recent movements, may worship nature, multiple deities, or even a single god. They often have unique beliefs and practices, different from major world religions.",
