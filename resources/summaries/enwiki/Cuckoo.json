	"summary": "Cuckoos are birds in the Cuculidae family, which includes roadrunners, koels, and anis. They are medium-sized and mostly live in trees, with a few ground-dwelling species. Found worldwide, most cuckoos live in tropical areas. They eat insects, larvae, and fruit, and some are migratory. Interestingly, some cuckoo species are \"brood parasites,\" meaning they lay their eggs in other birds' nests. Cuckoos have been part of human culture for ages, symbolizing various things like spring, love, and desire in different cultures.",
