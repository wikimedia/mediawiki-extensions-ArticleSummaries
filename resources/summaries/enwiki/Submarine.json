	"summary": "A submarine, or sub, is a special boat designed to travel underwater. It's different from a regular boat because it can operate independently below the surface. Submarines have been around since the 19th century and are used by many countries' navies. They're great for secret missions, attacking enemy ships, and even exploring the ocean.\n\nMost submarines look like a long cylinder with rounded ends. They have a special part called a \"sail\" or \"fin\" for communication and tools. Submarines move underwater using propellers and special tanks to control their buoyancy, allowing them to dive and resurface. Some are tiny, while others, like Russia's Typhoon class, are the largest ever built and can stay underwater for months.",
