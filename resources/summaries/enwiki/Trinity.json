These persons are God the Father, God the Son (Jesus), and God the Holy Spirit. The concept is based on the Bible's description of God's nature and the relationship between Jesus and God.\n\nThe Trinity was first taught by early Christian leaders who wanted to explain the complex relationship between Jesus and God. It's an important doctrine that defines who God is and how Christians understand the divine.",
