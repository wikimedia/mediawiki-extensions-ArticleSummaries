	"summary": "In 1971, a famous psychology experiment took place at Stanford University. It created a fake prison to see how people would act as prisoners or guards. Participants were paid to take part, and those assigned as guards wore uniforms and had to stop prisoners from escaping. Over time, the guards' behavior became very cruel. The experiment had to stop early because it was so harmful. Some people think this experiment is unethical and question its results. It made people realize the importance of following strict rules when doing research with humans.",
