	"summary": "Mormons are a religious group following teachings from the Book of Mormon, founded by Joseph Smith in the 1820s. After Smith's death, the movement split, with the largest group led by Brigham Young, now known as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Mormons believe in Jesus Christ and have unique doctrines, including a health code that avoids alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine. They value family, practice missionary work, and historically practiced polygamy, which ended in 1904. Today, Mormons are mostly found in North America, with over 16 million members worldwide.",
