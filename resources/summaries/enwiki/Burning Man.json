	"summary": "Burning Man is a yearly desert festival in the western U.S., focusing on community, art, self-expression, and independence. It gets its name from the burning of a large wooden \"Man\" statue on the Saturday before Labor Day. Since 1991, it's been held at Black Rock City, Nevada. The event is guided by ten principles, like including everyone, not selling things, and leaving no trace. Participants create all the art and activities, with a new theme each year. Originally a small beach gathering in 1986, it's now a huge event with over 78,000 people attending in 2019. It's organized by the Burning Man Project, a nonprofit.",
