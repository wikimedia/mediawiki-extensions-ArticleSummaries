	"summary": "Maitreya is a special being in Buddhism, known as a bodhisattva. He is predicted to become the next Buddha, succeeding Gautama Buddha. His name means \"loving-kindness\" and he is often called the \"Lord of Love.\" According to Buddhist beliefs, Maitreya will appear when people have forgotten the Buddha's teachings. He will teach and guide humans back to the right path. Many Buddhists think he lives in a heavenly place called Tushita. Some religious groups outside of Buddhism also believe in Maitreya as a future spiritual leader.",
