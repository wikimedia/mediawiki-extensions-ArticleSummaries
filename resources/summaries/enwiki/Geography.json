The word comes from ancient Greek, meaning \"writing about the Earth.\"\n\nThis subject has a long history, starting with early maps made by ancient civilizations like the Babylonians. A famous Greek scholar, Claudius Ptolemy, wrote an important book called \"Geography\" that influenced how people studied the world. Today, geographers use many tools, like maps, satellite images, and interviews, to understand the complex relationship between people and places.",
