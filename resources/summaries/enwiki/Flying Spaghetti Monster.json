	"summary": "The Flying Spaghetti Monster (FSM) is the god of a funny, made-up religion called Pastafarianism. It started as a joke to protest teaching intelligent design in schools. Pastafarians believe the FSM, an invisible monster made of spaghetti, created the universe after a big drinking session. They think pirates were the first Pastafarians. Although it's not a serious religion, Pastafarians have used it to argue against teaching intelligent design, showing that it's hard to prove or disprove such beliefs.",
