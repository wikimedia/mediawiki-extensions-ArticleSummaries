	"summary": "Conservatism is a way of thinking that wants to keep traditional ways and values. It's about protecting old customs and institutions like families, churches, and rules of law. People who follow this believe in keeping social order and respecting history.\n\nThe idea started in the 1790s with people like Edmund Burke, who liked the American Revolution but not the French one. It's a big ideology worldwide, found in many countries, and often linked to right-wing politics. It can have different forms, from libertarian to authoritarian.",
