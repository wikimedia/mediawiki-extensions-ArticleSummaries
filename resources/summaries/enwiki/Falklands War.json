	"summary": "The Falklands War was a conflict between Argentina and the United Kingdom in 1982. It started when Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands, which are British territories. The UK sent a military force to take back the islands. The war lasted for 74 days and ended with Argentina surrendering. Many people from both countries died.\n\nArgentina claimed the islands as its own, but the UK and the people living there wanted to stay British. This event was a big deal in both countries, leading to political changes. It also made people in Argentina very patriotic. Today, the two countries have friendly relations, but they still disagree about who owns the Falklands.",
