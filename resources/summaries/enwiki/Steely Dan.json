	"summary": "Steely Dan is an American rock band formed in 1971 by Walter Becker and Donald Fagen. They started as a full band but became a studio-only duo in 1974, using different musicians for each album. Their music mixes rock, jazz, Latin, R&B, and blues with clever lyrics. They had big success with albums like \"Aja\" (1977). After breaking up in 1981, they reunited in 1993 and won a Grammy for \"Two Against Nature\" (2000). Following Becker's death in 2017, Fagen continues the group. Steely Dan has sold over 40 million albums and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001.",
