	"summary": "A cock ring is a ring worn around the penis, usually at the base, to help maintain an erection. It restricts blood flow, making the erection stronger and longer-lasting. Cock rings can be made of silicone, metal, or titanium, and some have special features like studs or ergonomic designs. They can be used to treat erectile dysfunction or for aesthetic purposes, like enhancing the appearance of the genitals. Different types include glans rings (worn near the tip) and cock and ball rings (worn around both the penis and scrotum).",
