	"summary": "Scottish Gaelic is a language spoken by the Gaels in Scotland. It's part of the Celtic language family and developed from Old Irish. In the 2011 census, around 57,000 people in Scotland could speak it, mostly in the Outer Hebrides. Though the number of speakers has decreased, there's a revival effort. Some people in Canada, especially Nova Scotia, also speak a dialect called Canadian Gaelic. The Scottish government has taken steps to protect and promote the language.",
