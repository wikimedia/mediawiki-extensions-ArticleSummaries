	"summary": "Porcupines are big rodents with sharp, protective spines called quills. They come in two types: Old World porcupines from Asia, Africa, and Italy, and New World porcupines from North and South America. Old World porcupines are bigger, live on the ground, and are nocturnal. New World porcupines are smaller, live in trees, and are less nocturnal. Both have quills made of keratin, like hair. Porcupines are slow and defend themselves by showing their spines, which warn predators to stay away. They can be brown, grey, or white.",
