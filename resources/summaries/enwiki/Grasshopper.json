	"summary": "Grasshoppers are ancient insects that eat plants. They have powerful hind legs for jumping and front legs for gripping food. They don't undergo complete metamorphosis; instead, they hatch into nymphs and molt five times. Grasshoppers hear through tympanal organs and see with compound eyes. Some species can form swarms and turn into locusts, destroying crops. They protect themselves with camouflage and colorful wing flashes. Grasshoppers are affected by parasites, diseases, and predators. Humans have used them as food, featured them in art, and studied their species, called acridology.",
