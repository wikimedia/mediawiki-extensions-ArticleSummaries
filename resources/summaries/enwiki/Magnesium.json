	"summary": "Magnesium (symbol Mg) is a lightweight, shiny gray metal. It's highly reactive and combines with other elements naturally, especially in the Earth's crust. Magnesium is essential for life, playing a role in our body's cells and many enzymes. It's also used in strong, lightweight alloys, often with aluminum. \n\nIn nature, magnesium is made in stars and found in seawater and the Earth's mantle. Its reactivity helps form a protective coating, preventing further corrosion. This element is crucial, ranking 8th in abundance in Earth's crust and 11th in the human body.",
