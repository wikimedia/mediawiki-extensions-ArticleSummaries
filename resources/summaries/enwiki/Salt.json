It's one of the oldest food seasonings, enhancing taste and preserving food. Ancient civilizations valued salt, trading it across the Mediterranean and Sahara. Today, salt is mined and harvested from seawater, mainly used in chemical production, water treatment, and de-icing. Edible salt, like table salt and sea salt, should be consumed in moderation due to potential health risks like hypertension. The World Health Organization advises adults to limit sodium intake to 2,000 mg daily.",
