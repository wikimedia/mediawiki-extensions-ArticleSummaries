	"summary": "## The Nation of Islam: A Simplified Summary\n\nThe Nation of Islam (NOI) is a religious group started in the U.S. in 1930 by Wallace Fard Muhammad. It teaches that black people are superior and were created by a black god, while white people are violent and lack inner divinity. The NOI wants African Americans to have their own nation and be independent. They believe Fard Muhammad will return to Earth in a spaceship to defeat the white race.\n\nThe group has famous members like Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali, but is considered a hate group by some because of its racist and anti-Semitic beliefs. Many Muslims also say its teachings are not true Islam.",
