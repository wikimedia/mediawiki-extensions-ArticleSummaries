	"summary": "The U.S. has 50 states, each with its own government and powers. States are like small countries within the U.S., with their own laws and local governments. They have power over things like schools, health, and local roads. \n\nPeople in states are citizens of both the U.S. and their state. You can move freely between states, except in special cases. States work together with the federal government, and they also argue about how much power they should have. The U.S. Constitution says new states can join, but it doesn't let states leave.",
