	"summary": "The Mississippi River is the second-longest river in the United States, flowing from Minnesota to the Gulf of Mexico. It drains water from 32 states and two Canadian provinces. Native Americans lived along the river for thousands of years, and Europeans arrived in the 16th century, changing the region. The river played a vital role in transportation and the country's expansion. It is very fertile, but it has also faced pollution issues. The Mississippi's capture during the Civil War was a turning point in the war. Today, it continues to be an important waterway for the country.",
