	"summary": "Guerrilla warfare is a type of fighting where small groups use surprise attacks and tricks against bigger, more regular armies. It's been used for a long time, even before the term was invented during the Peninsular War in the 1800s. Famous thinkers like Sun Tzu and Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus came up with these tactics thousands of years ago. Guerrilla warfare is often used by rebels and people fighting against armies that have taken over their land. These groups try to wear down the enemy without direct, big battles. They often get help from local people who support their cause.",
