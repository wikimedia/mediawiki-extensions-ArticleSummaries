	"summary": "Mathematics is a subject that explores different methods, theories, and rules to understand abstract concepts. It has many branches, like number theory, algebra, geometry, and analysis, each studying unique aspects of numbers, shapes, and changes. Math uses logical reasoning to prove ideas, called theorems, and these proofs are based on already known facts and rules.\n\nIt is a powerful tool used in science, technology, and everyday life. While some math is directly inspired by real-world problems, other areas are purely theoretical, but often find practical uses later. The ancient Greeks started the tradition of mathematical proofs, and over time, math has evolved with new fields and applications.",
