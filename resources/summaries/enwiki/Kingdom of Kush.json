	"summary": "The Kingdom of Kush was an ancient civilization in Nubia (modern-day Sudan and southern Egypt). It was a powerful region with complex societies and a rich history. The Kushites had their own language and culture, and they controlled a large area along the Nile River. They often interacted with Egypt, sometimes through warfare and sometimes through trade and marriage. Kushite kings even ruled Egypt for a time. The kingdom lasted for centuries but eventually declined due to internal conflicts and invasions.",
