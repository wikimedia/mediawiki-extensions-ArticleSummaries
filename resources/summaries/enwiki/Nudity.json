	"summary": "Nudity is being without clothes. For most of human history, people were naked, but as societies developed, clothing became a form of communication and social status. In ancient Mediterranean civilizations, proper attire was essential for social standing. However, in many cultures, nudity was natural and not linked to shame or sexuality.\n\nWith the rise of Judeo-Christian beliefs, nudity became associated with sin. Western ideas of modest dress spread globally through colonialism. Today, nudity's acceptance varies; some see it as positive in art and recreation, while others disapprove due to religious or cultural beliefs.",
