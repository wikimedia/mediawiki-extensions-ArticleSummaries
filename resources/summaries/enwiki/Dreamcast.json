	"summary": "The Dreamcast was the last video game console made by Sega. It came out in 1998 in Japan and later in North America and Europe. It was the first of the sixth-generation consoles, before the PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Xbox. The Dreamcast used cheaper parts, like a Hitachi CPU and NEC GPU, and had a special disc format to save costs. It was the first console with a built-in modem for online play.\n\nDespite a big marketing push, sales dropped as the PlayStation 2 gained popularity. Sega stopped making the Dreamcast in 2001 and became a game developer. Only 9.13 million were sold, with Sonic Adventure being the top-selling game. The Dreamcast's failure is blamed on tough competition and Sega's past mistakes. But today, it's remembered as a great console with innovative games and ideas.",
