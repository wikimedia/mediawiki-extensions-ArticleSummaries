	"summary": "Bats are unique mammals that can fly, making them more agile than birds. They are small, with the smallest being Kitti's hog-nosed bat, and some can grow quite large, like the giant golden-crowned flying fox. Bats make up about 20% of all mammal species and are divided into two main groups: fruit-eating megabats and echolocating microbats. They are nocturnal and often live in caves. Bats help the environment by pollinating plants and eating insects, but they can also carry diseases like rabies. In different cultures, bats symbolize various things, from protection to darkness and malevolence.",
