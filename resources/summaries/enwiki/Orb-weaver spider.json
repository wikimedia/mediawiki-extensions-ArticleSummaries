	"summary": "Orb-weaver spiders, part of the Araneidae family, are known for building circular, wheel-shaped webs often seen in gardens and forests. They have eight eyes and hairy legs. With over 3,000 species worldwide, they are one of the largest spider families. Their webs are made in a specific way: first, a non-sticky framework, then a spiral of sticky silk. Other spider families also make similar webs. Related groups, like long-jawed orb weavers, were once included in Araneidae but are now classified separately.",
