	"summary": "**Still Wakes the Deep** is a scary video game where you play as an electrician stuck on a broken oil rig in the 1970s North Sea. There are monsters after you, so you have to hide and solve easy puzzles to stay alive. The rig changes as you play, but the game mostly goes in one direction. The game is creepy on purpose, with the ocean being one of the scariest parts. It was made by a team that wanted to bring back scary stories, and they got ideas from movies like *The Poseidon Adventure*. The game came out in 2024 and people liked its story, looks, and sounds, but some thought it was too simple and short.",
