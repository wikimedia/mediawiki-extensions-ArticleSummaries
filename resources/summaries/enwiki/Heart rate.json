	"summary": "Heart rate is how many times your heart beats in one minute (beats per minute, or bpm). It changes depending on your body's needs, like getting oxygen and removing carbon dioxide. Many things can affect it, like fitness level, stress, and health.\n\nA normal adult heart rate is between 60 and 100 bpm when resting. Athletes might have a lower rate, around 37-38 bpm. If it's above 100 bpm, it's called tachycardia; below 60 bpm is bradycardia. During sleep, a heart rate of 40-50 bpm is normal. An irregular heartbeat is called an arrhythmia.",
