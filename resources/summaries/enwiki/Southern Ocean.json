	"summary": "The Southern Ocean, also called the Antarctic Ocean, is the body of water surrounding Antarctica. It's the second smallest of the world's five main oceans and covers about 7.8 million square miles. This ocean is defined as the water south of 60Â°S latitude. The deepest point, named \"Factorian Deep,\" is 7,434 meters (24,390 feet) below the surface.\n\nFor a long time, geographers debated whether this ocean existed or if it was just part of other oceans. But now, scientists agree it's a separate ocean because of its unique circulation pattern, which is important for the planet's climate. However, this circulation is being affected by climate change, which could cause big changes in weather and marine life.",
