First found in plant ashes, it's an alkali metal that easily loses its outer electron to form ions. Potassium is essential for living things; it helps nerves work properly. We get potassium from fruits and vegetables. Industrially, potassium is used in fertilizers because plants need it to grow. It's also found in seawater and certain rocks.",
