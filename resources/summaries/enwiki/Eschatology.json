	"summary": "Eschatology is about predicting the end of the world or human history. Many religions believe in an \"end times\" event, like the \"Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse\" in Christianity. This idea is found in both Abrahamic (Judaism, Christianity, Islam) and non-Abrahamic religions (Hinduism, Buddhism).\n\nIn these beliefs, the end might bring a new beginning, with heroes like the Messiah or Kalki (Hinduism) saving the day. Scientists also discuss the universe's end, with theories like the Big Freeze. Some even worry about events that could wipe out humanity.",
