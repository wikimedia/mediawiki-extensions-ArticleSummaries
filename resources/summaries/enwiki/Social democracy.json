	"summary": "Social democracy is a political and economic idea that supports democracy and a gradual move towards socialism. It aims to reduce inequality and help the less fortunate through welfare programs and a strong welfare state. Social democrats believe in a mixed economy with both private and public ownership, and they support regulating capitalism. This philosophy originated in the 19th-century labor movement and has been associated with the Nordic model and Keynesian economics. It's often seen as a more moderate form of socialism, different from the authoritarian Soviet model.",
