	"summary": "Torque is like a turning force, similar to how force pushes or pulls. It's often used when twisting something, like turning a screw with a screwdriver. The symbol for torque is Ï„ (tau). You calculate it based on the force applied and the distance from the axis of rotation. For instance, a 3-newton force at 2 meters creates the same torque as a 1-newton force at 6 meters.",
