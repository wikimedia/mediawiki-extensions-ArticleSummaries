	"summary": "The respiratory system helps animals and plants exchange gases. It varies by species. In mammals, birds, and some land animals, it includes lungs with tiny air sacs (alveoli in mammals, atria in birds) for gas exchange. These sacs are connected to the outside by airways, like the trachea and bronchi. Fish and some aquatic animals use gills, which are external organs in water, to exchange gases. Insects and amphibians have simpler systems, and even skin can be involved. Plants also have a respiratory system, but gas exchange works differently.",
