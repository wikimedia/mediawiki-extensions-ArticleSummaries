	"summary": "## Protons: The Heart of Atoms\n\nProtons are tiny, positively charged particles found in the center (nucleus) of every atom. They're like the glue that holds atoms together. The number of protons in an atom's nucleus defines what kind of element it is. For example, hydrogen atoms have one proton, while oxygen atoms have eight.\n\nProtons were discovered by Ernest Rutherford and were once thought to be basic building blocks of matter. We now know they're made up of even smaller particles called quarks.",
