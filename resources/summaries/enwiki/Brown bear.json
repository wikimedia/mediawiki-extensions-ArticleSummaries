	"summary": "The brown bear is a big, strong bear found in Eurasia and North America. It's one of the largest meat-eating animals on land, but it mostly eats plants, like fruits and nuts. These bears have special hump muscles and big paws for digging. They live in forests and mountains, and some even eat salmon near the coast. Brown bears usually live alone but have babies, called cubs, which stay with their mom for a few years. They are smart and can live up to 25 years in the wild.\n\nEven though they are powerful, attacks on humans are rare. Unfortunately, some brown bear populations are in danger due to hunting and habitat loss.",
