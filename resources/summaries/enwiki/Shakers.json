	"summary": "The Shakers are a Christian group that started in England around 1747 and later moved to the U.S. They got their name from their energetic worship, which included shaking. Shakers believe in equality and live together in communities, sharing everything. They don't marry or have children, and both men and women can be leaders.\n\nAt their peak, there were thousands of Shakers living in many communities. But over time, the group got smaller as people left and not many new members joined. Today, there is only one active Shaker village left in Maine, and many old Shaker settlements are now museums.",
