	"summary": "Mpox (formerly monkeypox) is a viral disease that causes a rash, fever, and swollen lymph nodes. It's usually mild, but can be severe for some people. The virus spreads through direct contact with infected animals or people. You can catch it from handling infected meat or through bites and scratches. \n\nDoctors can test for mpox using a special lab test. There's no specific treatment, but vaccines that protect against smallpox also work against mpox. Antiviral drugs might help, but more research is needed. Mpox is mainly found in Central and Western Africa, but it has spread to other parts of the world. Health experts are working hard to control the outbreaks.",
