	"summary": "Demons are evil spirits found in many ancient and modern beliefs. They are often linked to mythology, religion, and folklore. The idea of demons might have begun in the Paleolithic age, when people feared the unknown. In ancient Near Eastern and Abrahamic religions, demons could possess people, needing an exorcism.\n\nGreek philosophy once saw demons as neutral spirits, but Christianity changed this, making them evil. Today, demons still appear in religion and popular culture, often as powerful, scary beings. Some people believe in their ability to possess, while others see them as symbols of inner struggles.",
