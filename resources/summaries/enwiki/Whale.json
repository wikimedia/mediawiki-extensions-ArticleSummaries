	"summary": "Whales are large marine mammals found in oceans worldwide. They are related to dolphins and porpoises and have diverse species, like the blue whale (the largest animal ever) and the dwarf sperm whale. Some have baleen plates for filtering food, while others have teeth. Whales evolved from land animals but are now fully aquatic, needing to surface for air. They are fast swimmers and communicate with various sounds.\n\nOnce hunted extensively, whales are now protected due to declining populations. Indigenous cultures often respect and utilize whales, and they also hold a place in global art and literature.",
