	"summary": "Sperm, or spermatozoa, are tiny cells in semen, a fluid produced by males. They are crucial for reproduction as they fertilize female egg cells. Semen, also called seminal fluid, is made by male reproductive organs and contains nutrients that help sperm survive and move. In humans, it includes enzymes and fructose. This fluid is designed to be released into the vagina during ejaculation, allowing sperm to reach the uterus and create a new life. Collecting semen from animals is useful for breeding programs and preserving species.",
