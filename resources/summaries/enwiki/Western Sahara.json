	"summary": "Western Sahara is a large, mostly desert territory in Africa. It used to be controlled by Spain but is now claimed by Morocco and a group called the Polisario Front, who want independence. The United Nations considers it a \"non-self-governing territory,\" meaning it needs to decide its own future.\n\nMorocco controls most of the land, while the Polisario Front, supported by Algeria, governs a smaller part. Many countries don't take sides, but some recognize Morocco's claim, and others support the Polisario Front's right to self-determination. The African Union has tried to help, but a final decision is still needed.",
