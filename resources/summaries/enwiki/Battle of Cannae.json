This is considered one of the worst Roman defeats and one of the greatest military tactics ever. Almost 71,000 Romans were killed. After the battle, some Italian cities switched sides to Carthage. Rome was scared and took extreme measures, even sacrificing people to their gods. Despite the huge loss, Rome kept fighting for 14 more years until they won. Cannae is now famous for how completely Hannibal defeated the Romans.",
