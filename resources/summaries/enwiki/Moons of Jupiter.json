	"summary": "Jupiter has 95 known moons, with the four largest being the Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. These were discovered in 1610 and are massive enough to be considered planets if they orbited the Sun. Smaller moons, called irregular satellites, have been found since 1892 and are named after lovers or daughters of the Roman god Jupiter. Most moons have circular orbits, but some have irregular, distant paths. Jupiter likely has around 100 large irregular moons and 500 smaller ones.",
