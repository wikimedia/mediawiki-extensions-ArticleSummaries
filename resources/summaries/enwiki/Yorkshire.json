It's known for its strong local identity and diverse landscapes, from busy cities like Leeds and Sheffield in the southwest to the North York Moors and the Yorkshire Dales in the north and west. Historically, it was the largest county in the UK and was divided into three ridings (North, East, and West). Today, it's split into four ceremonial counties.
