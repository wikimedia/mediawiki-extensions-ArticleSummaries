	"summary": "Machu Picchu is an ancient Inca city high in the mountains of Peru. Built in the 15th century, it's often called the \"Lost City\" because it was hidden from the outside world for centuries. The Incas didn't leave written records, so we don't know much about its history. Archaeologists believe it was a special place for Emperor Pachacuti.\n\nThe city has amazing stone buildings, like the Temple of the Sun, and a beautiful location near a river. It was rediscovered in the 19th century and is now a famous UNESCO World Heritage Site, known as one of the New Seven Wonders of the World.",
