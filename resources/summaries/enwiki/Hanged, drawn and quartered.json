	"summary": "This harsh punishment was used in medieval and early modern Britain and Ireland for men who committed high treason. The process involved being dragged to the execution site, hanged, then cut open, beheaded, and chopped into pieces. The remains were displayed publicly as a warning. It was introduced in England by King Edward III in 1352. Women convicted of treason were instead burned at the stake. This punishment was used for serious crimes like attacking the king's authority. It was eventually replaced by hanging and then abolished in 1870.",
