	"summary": "The Palace of Westminster in London, England, is where the UK Parliament meets. It's often called the Houses of Parliament because it holds the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Originally a royal home, it became a parliamentary building after a fire in 1512. Another big fire in 1834 led to its reconstruction in the Gothic style, designed by Charles Barry. The palace, famous for Big Ben (the Elizabeth Tower), is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It's currently in need of major repairs.",
