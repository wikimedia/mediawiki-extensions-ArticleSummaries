	"summary": "Earwigs are a type of insect found almost everywhere except Antarctica. They have distinctive pincers on their abdomen and wings they rarely use. Some are tiny parasites. Earwigs are mostly active at night, eating insects and plants. They go through five molts before becoming adults. Female earwigs sometimes take care of their eggs and young. Fossils show earwigs have been around for a very long time. They are related to other insects like stoneflies but the exact connection is unclear.",
