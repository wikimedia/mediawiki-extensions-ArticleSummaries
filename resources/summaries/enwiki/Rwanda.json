	"summary": "Rwanda is a small, landlocked country in East Africa, known for its hilly landscape. It has a long history, with ancient hunter-gatherers and Bantu people settling the area. The Kingdom of Rwanda united many clans in the 15th century. Later, it was colonized by Germany and Belgium, who favored the Tutsi minority. This led to tensions and the Rwandan genocide in 1994. \n\nToday, Rwanda is led by President Paul Kagame and has a young, rural population. The country is working on improving its economy, with agriculture and tourism as key sectors. It is also a member of various international organizations.",
