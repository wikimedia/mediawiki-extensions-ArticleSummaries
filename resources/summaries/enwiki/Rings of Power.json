	"summary": "In J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy world, the Rings of Power are magical rings with special abilities. The most famous is the One Ring, first seen in *The Hobbit*, which gives its wearer invisibility and great power. There are also nineteen other Great Rings, each with unique powers.\n\nThese rings have an addictive quality, especially the One Ring, which was created by the evil Sauron. It corrupts and enslaves its users, turning them into the fearsome Nazg√ªl. Tolkien drew inspiration from various sources, including Germanic myths and Wagner's opera. The rings symbolize the struggle between power and moral behavior, as seen through the eyes of different characters in *The Lord of the Rings*.",
