	"summary": "In September 1964, South Vietnam's leader General Nguyễn Khánh faced a coup attempt led by Generals Lâm Văn Phát and Dương Văn Đức. They took over key places in Saigon and announced on the radio that they had taken power. With help from the Americans, Khánh got support and stopped the coup the next day without any deaths. This happened after Khánh had trouble with protests and removed some officials, making Catholic officers angry. The coup failed when more officers supported Khánh, and the rebels gave up. Khánh later removed some leaders he thought were involved, but the event weakened his rule and he was eventually removed from power in 1965.",
