	"summary": "Cyprus is an island country in the Mediterranean Sea, located east of Greece. It has a long history, with early settlements dating back 13,000 years. The island has been ruled by many, including ancient Greeks, the Ottoman Empire, and the British. It gained independence in 1960 but faced ethnic tensions between Greek and Turkish Cypriots. In 1974, a Greek-backed coup led to a Turkish invasion, dividing the island. Today, Cyprus is a tourist hotspot with a strong economy and is part of the European Union.",
