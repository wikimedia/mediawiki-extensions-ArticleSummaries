	"summary": "The Arab Spring was a big series of protests and rebellions across the Arab world in the 2010s. It started in Tunisia because people were angry about corruption and the economy. The protests spread to many countries like Libya, Egypt, and Syria. Leaders were removed in some places, but there was also a lot of violence and conflict.\n\nThe Arab Spring wanted to end corruption and bring democracy, but it led to wars and crises in many countries. Some people call this time the \"Arab Winter\" because of the ongoing problems. Even now, protests against unfair governments still happen in Arab countries.",
