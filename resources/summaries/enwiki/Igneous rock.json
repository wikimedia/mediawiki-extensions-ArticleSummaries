	"summary": "Igneous rocks are formed from cooled magma or lava, making them one of the three main rock types. This process can happen underground (intrusive) or on the surface (extrusive). The magma often comes from melting existing rocks deep within the Earth. Heat, pressure changes, or composition shifts can cause this melting. Sometimes, the cooling process forms crystals, creating a rocky texture, or it can result in a glass-like appearance. Volcanic eruptions are a common way igneous rocks are brought to the surface.",
