	"summary": "Sukkot is a Jewish holiday lasting 7-8 days, celebrating the harvest and remembering the Exodus from Egypt. It's one of three pilgrimage festivals, where people used to travel to the Temple in Jerusalem. The name means \"Booths\" or \"Tabernacles,\" referring to the temporary huts farmers lived in during the harvest. People now eat and sometimes sleep in these huts, called sukkah, to remember the Israelites' journey through the desert. Special rituals involve waving four plants, symbolizing joy and gratitude.",
