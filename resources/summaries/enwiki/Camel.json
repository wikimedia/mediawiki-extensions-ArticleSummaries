	"summary": "Camels are large desert animals with humps on their backs. They are domesticated and used for transportation, food (milk and meat), and textiles. There are three types: the dromedary (one hump), Bactrian (two humps), and the wild Bactrian camel. Camels are even-toed ungulates, and their name comes from ancient languages like Latin and Greek. The term 'camelid' refers to all seven species in the Camelidae family, including llamas and alpacas. Camelids originated in North America and later migrated to Asia.",
