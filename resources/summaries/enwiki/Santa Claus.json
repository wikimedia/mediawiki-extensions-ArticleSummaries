	"summary": "Santa Claus, also known as Saint Nicholas, is a famous character in Western Christian culture. He's believed to bring gifts on Christmas Eve with the help of elves and flying reindeer. This idea comes from stories about a kind 4th-century bishop, Saint Nicholas, known for giving gifts secretly.\n\nToday, Santa is usually pictured as a happy, bearded man in red and white clothes, carrying a bag of gifts. This image became popular in North America during the 19th century, influenced by Dutch traditions.",
