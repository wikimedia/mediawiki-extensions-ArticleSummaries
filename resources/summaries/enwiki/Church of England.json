	"summary": "The Church of England (C of E) is the main Christian church in England. It started as part of the Roman Catholic Church but broke away in the 16th century when King Henry VIII wanted to divorce his wife. This event, known as the English Reformation, led to the church becoming Protestant. Over time, the church developed its own unique blend of Catholic and Protestant practices, called Anglicanism. Today, the Church of England is led by the Archbishop of Canterbury and the British monarch, and it has different groups with varying beliefs.",
