	"summary": "## Greenhouse Gases and Global Warming\n\nGreenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide and methane, trap heat from the sun in Earth's atmosphere. This keeps our planet warm enough to live on. But, human activities, especially burning fossil fuels, have increased these gases. This extra gas causes global warming, making the Earth hotter. If we don't reduce these gases, the planet could become dangerously warm in the next few decades.",
