	"summary": "In the Bible story, Goliath was a huge Philistine warrior, standing at almost 10 feet tall. He challenged the Israelites to a fight, but King Saul was too scared. David, a young shepherd, stepped up and defeated Goliath using just a sling and a stone. This showed that Saul was not a good leader. Some experts think the real killer of Goliath might have been someone else, but the story was changed to make David the hero. Today, \"David and Goliath\" is a popular phrase for when a small, weak person beats a large, strong opponent.",
