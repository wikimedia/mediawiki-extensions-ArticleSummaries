	"summary": "Megalodon, meaning \"big tooth,\" was an enormous shark that lived millions of years ago. It was initially thought to be related to the great white shark but is now classified as a distinct extinct species. Scientists believe it was one of the largest predators ever, reaching up to 67 feet in length. Its powerful jaws could crush bones, and it likely hunted large marine animals like whales.\n\nThe cooling of oceans during the ice ages and the loss of its habitat might have led to its extinction. Megalodon's disappearance coincides with changes in whale populations, suggesting a possible link to their food sources.",
