	"summary": "Norepinephrine, also known as noradrenaline, is a hormone and neurotransmitter that helps our bodies get ready for action. It's like a natural energy boost. When we're awake or in a stressful situation, our bodies release more of it. This increases our heart rate, makes us more alert, and helps us focus. It's produced in a part of the brain called the locus coeruleus and also by the adrenal glands. Many medicines, like those for low blood pressure or ADHD, work by changing how norepinephrine works in our bodies.",
