	"summary": "Narcissism is when someone is too focused on themselves and their own needs, often ignoring others. It can range from normal to unhealthy. A little narcissism is okay, but too much can be a problem. Extreme narcissism can be a mental health issue called Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD), which makes it hard for people to function well in daily life. Caravaggio's painting, *Narcissus*, shows a man who is obsessed with his own reflection.",
