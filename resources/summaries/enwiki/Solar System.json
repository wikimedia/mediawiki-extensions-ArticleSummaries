	"summary": "Our Solar System is a collection of objects, including the Sun and eight planets, held together by gravity. It formed billions of years ago from a collapsing cloud of gas and dust. The Sun, a G-type star, is at its center, with planets like Earth, Jupiter, and Neptune orbiting around it. There are also smaller objects like asteroids, comets, and dwarf planets, such as Pluto and Ceres.\n\nThe Solar System extends to about 2,000â€“200,000 astronomical units (AU), with the closest star, Proxima Centauri, being 269,000 AU away. The Sun's influence reaches the heliopause, beyond which lies interstellar space.",
