	"summary": "The Civil Rights Movement in the United States (1954-1968) fought against racial segregation and discrimination. It aimed to secure equal rights for all Americans, especially African Americans. After the Civil War, amendments to the Constitution granted freedom and rights to African Americans, but these were often taken away by racist laws.\n\nThe movement used nonviolent protests, like boycotts and sit-ins, to challenge segregation. Important events included the Montgomery bus boycott and marches in Selma. The Supreme Court made key rulings against discrimination, and new laws like the Civil Rights Act (1964) and Voting Rights Act (1965) protected people's rights.\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. was a famous leader, but many people and groups contributed to the movement's success.",
