	"summary": "The Cherokee are an Indigenous group originally from the southeastern United States. They lived in what is now North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama. The Cherokee language is related to other Iroquoian languages. Some believe they migrated from the Great Lakes region, while others think their origins are in the Appalachian area.\n\nIn the 19th century, White settlers considered the Cherokee one of the \"Five Civilized Tribes\" due to their farming lifestyle and adoption of Western culture. Today, three Cherokee tribes are officially recognized by the US government, with the largest being the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma. Many people claim Cherokee ancestry, but not all are enrolled tribal members.",
