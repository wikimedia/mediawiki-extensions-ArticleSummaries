	"summary": "The Great Depression was a big global economic problem from 1929 to 1939. It started when stock prices in the U.S. dropped sharply, causing a stock market crash. This led to tough times with many people losing jobs and businesses failing. Worldwide, GDP fell by 15%. Some places started to get better in the 1930s, but the bad effects lasted until World War II. Cities and farms suffered, and many countries stopped building. Some people think the stock market crash caused it, while others say it was just a sign of bigger problems already happening.",
