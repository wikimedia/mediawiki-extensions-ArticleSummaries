	"summary": "The Black Sea is a large body of water between Europe and Asia, bordering six countries. It's connected to the Mediterranean Sea through the Turkish Straits. This sea is unique because it has layers of water that don't mix; the deeper layer has no oxygen, preserving ancient shipwrecks.\n\nImportant rivers like the Danube flow into it, and cities like Istanbul (near the Bosporus) and Odessa are on its coast. The Black Sea's shape is long and narrow, with mountains around most of it. It's an important area for trade and history.",
