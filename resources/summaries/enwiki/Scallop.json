	"summary": "Scallops are marine animals, a type of bivalve mollusk, found in oceans worldwide. They can move and swim, unlike most bivalves, and have simple eyes around their shells' edges. Some live freely on sandy bottoms, while others attach to rocks or seagrass. Scallops are a popular food source and are farmed. Their beautiful shells, often fan-shaped with fluted patterns, are collected and used in art and design. These shells are also a common find on beaches, making them a favorite for beachgoers.",
