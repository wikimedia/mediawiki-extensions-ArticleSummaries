	"summary": "A banshee is a female fairy spirit from Irish legends. She announces the death of a family member with loud, sad sounds like screams or wails. The name comes from the Irish word \"bean síde,\" meaning \"woman of the fairy mound.\" These mounds, called \"síde,\" are special places in Irish mythology. When a banshee cries, it's a sign that someone in the family is about to die.",
