It's a big problem caused by things like burning fossil fuels and car exhaust. Air pollution is really bad for our health, especially our lungs and heart, and can even lead to early death. It also hurts the environment, contributing to issues like climate change.\n\nMany countries have laws to control pollution, and some international agreements have helped, but there's still a lot of work to do. The good news is, there are technologies and strategies to reduce it.",
