People with narcolepsy might also experience vivid dreams, sleep paralysis, and cataplexy (sudden muscle weakness). There are two types: Type 1 includes cataplexy and low orexin levels, while Type 2 doesn't have cataplexy.\n\nThe cause is unknown, but it might be an autoimmune disorder. It can start in childhood and affects both males and females. There's no cure, but treatment includes lifestyle changes, support groups, and medications to manage sleepiness and cataplexy.",
