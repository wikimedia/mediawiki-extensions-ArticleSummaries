	"summary": "Bauhaus, meaning \"building house\" in German, was an art school that changed how we think about design. Founded in 1919 by Walter Gropius, it wanted to merge art with mass production, focusing on function. This style became super popular and influenced modern design, architecture, and art education.\n\nThe school moved to different cities and had various leaders, each bringing new ideas. It started in Weimar, then moved to Dessau and Berlin. Famous artists like Paul Klee and Wassily Kandinsky taught there. Unfortunately, it closed in 1933 due to Nazi pressure. But its impact lived on, especially in the U.S., where its leaders became known for their unique style.",
