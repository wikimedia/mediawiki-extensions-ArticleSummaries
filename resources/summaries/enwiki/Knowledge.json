Philosophers debate how we know if something is truly knowledge. Some say it needs to be justified, while others focus on how well it fits with our other beliefs.\n\nDifferent fields like science, religion, and anthropology study how we get knowledge and what it means.  Epistemology is the specific field that investigates the nature of knowledge itself.",
