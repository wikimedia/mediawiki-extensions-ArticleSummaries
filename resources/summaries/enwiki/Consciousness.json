	"summary": "Consciousness is simply being aware of yourself and the world around you. For many years, philosophers, scientists, and theologians have tried to understand its true nature. Some see consciousness as the mind itself, while others view it as just a part of the mind. Historically, it was seen as one's inner thoughts and feelings. Today, it's often described as our overall experience, including our feelings, thoughts, and perceptions. It could be our awareness of ourselves and our thoughts, or even our understanding of our own thinking processes.",
