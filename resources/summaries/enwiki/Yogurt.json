	"summary": "Yogurt is a popular food made by fermenting milk with special bacteria. This process gives yogurt its unique tangy taste and creamy texture. It is usually made from cow's milk but can also be produced using milk from other animals like goats and sheep.\n\nThe bacteria used are called *Lactobacillus* and *Streptococcus*. They turn the sugar in the milk into lactic acid, which changes the milk's structure. The temperature is carefully controlled during fermentation to get the right consistency. Different types of milk and bacteria combinations create various yogurt varieties.",
