	"summary": "AI's history started with ancient myths about intelligent artificial beings. The idea grew with the development of programmable computers in the 1940s. In 1956, a group of scientists at Dartmouth College officially began AI research, aiming to create machines as smart as humans. They got lots of funding but faced big challenges. In the 1970s, governments stopped funding due to criticism, but Japan's support and expert systems revived AI in the 1980s. After a slow period in the 1990s, AI grew again with machine learning and deep learning in the 2000s and 2010s, leading to today's impressive AI technologies.",
