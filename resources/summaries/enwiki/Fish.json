	"summary": "Fish are aquatic animals with fins and gills that live in water. They can be divided into two main groups: jawless fish and jawed fish. Jawed fish include cartilaginous fish (like sharks) and bony fish, which are the most common. Fish have been around for millions of years and have evolved into many different species. Some fish, like tuna and sharks, can keep their body temperature higher than the water around them. Humans have used fish as a food source for a long time and also keep them as pets in aquariums.",
