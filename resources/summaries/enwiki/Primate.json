	"summary": "**Primates: An Overview**\n\nPrimates are a group of mammals that include lemurs, monkeys, apes, and humans. They evolved from small terrestrial mammals around 85â€“55 million years ago, adapting to life in tropical forests. Primates have large brains, good vision, and opposable thumbs. They range in size from tiny mouse lemurs to huge gorillas.\n\nPrimates are social and often live in groups. They communicate using gestures, smells, and sounds. Some, like humans, use tools. However, many primate species are threatened by habitat loss, hunting, and disease.",
