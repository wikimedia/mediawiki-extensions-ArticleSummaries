	"summary": "Mount Everest is the highest mountain on Earth, located in Asia's Himalayas. It stands at an incredible 29,035 feet (8,850 meters) above sea level. Mountains are formed by powerful Earth forces over millions of years. They are taller than hills, with steep sides and exposed rock. Mount Everest's height creates a cold climate, affecting the plants and animals that live there. It's a challenging place for humans, often used for adventures like climbing and skiing, and for resource extraction like mining.",
