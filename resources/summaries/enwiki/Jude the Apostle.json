	"summary": "Jude, one of Jesus' twelve apostles, is also known as Thaddeus. He is not the same person as Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus. Early English translators shortened his name to Jude to avoid confusion. Jude is considered a patron saint of desperate situations. He is often shown in art with a club, a flame around his head (symbolizing the Holy Spirit), or holding an image of Jesus. He is also associated with a scroll or book, representing his epistle.",
