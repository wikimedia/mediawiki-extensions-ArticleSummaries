	"summary": "The Warrens were a famous American couple who investigated haunted houses and paranormal activities. Edward, a demonologist, and Lorraine, a clairvoyant, founded the New England Society for Psychic Research in 1952. They wrote many books and claimed to have investigated over 10,000 cases. Their work inspired popular movies like *The Amityville Horror* and *The Conjuring*. However, some people, including skeptic investigators, believe their evidence is not reliable and that some of the hauntings they investigated never actually happened.",
