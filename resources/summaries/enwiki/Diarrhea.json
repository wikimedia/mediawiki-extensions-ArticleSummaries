	"summary": "Diarrhea is when you have three or more loose, watery bowel movements in a day. It can make you dehydrated, so it's important to drink lots of fluids. The most common cause is an infection from viruses, bacteria, or parasites, often from contaminated food or water. Other causes include lactose intolerance and irritable bowel syndrome.\n\nTo prevent diarrhea, wash your hands often, drink clean water, and avoid contaminated food. If you have diarrhea, drink oral rehydration solution (ORS) and take zinc tablets. Antibiotics might be needed in some cases. Diarrhea is common worldwide, but it's most serious for young children in developing countries.",
