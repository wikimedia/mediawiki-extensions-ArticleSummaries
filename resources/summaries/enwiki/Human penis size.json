	"summary": "Human penis size varies, especially between flaccid and erect states. Many factors can affect its size, like arousal and temperature. Compared to other primates, the human penis is the thickest. Most growth happens between infancy and age 17. Studies show the average erect length is 5.17 inches, and circumference is 4.59 inches. Flaccid length isn't always a good predictor of erect size. A micropenis is medically defined as an abnormally small, but normally shaped, adult penis, usually under 3 inches. Research finds no link between penis size and other body parts.",
