	"summary": "A floppy disk is a soft, magnetic disk inside a plastic case. It's used to store data, like pictures or documents. There were three main sizes: 8-inch, 5¼-inch, and 3½-inch. The 3½-inch disk was the most common.\n\nInvented by IBM in 1971, floppy disks were a popular way to save and share data until the early 2000s. Now, we use USB drives and cloud storage, as they can hold much more data and are faster. You might still see floppy disk icons in computer programs, though!",
