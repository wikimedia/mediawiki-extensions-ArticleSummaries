	"summary": "Conspiracy theories suggest that powerful groups are secretly plotting to control events. People believe these theories even when there's little proof. They can be harmful, leading to distrust and even violence. For example, some people think the US government is linked to secret organizations like the Illuminati.\n\nResearchers say these beliefs might come from feeling uncertain or anxious. They can also be linked to mental health conditions. However, others argue that conspiracy theories are a common human behavior, not always a sign of mental health issues.",
