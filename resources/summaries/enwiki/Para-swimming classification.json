	"summary": "Para-swimming classification groups athletes with disabilities into classes to ensure fair competition. Classes are labeled S1 to S15, with lower numbers indicating more severe disabilities. Swimmers with physical disabilities are in S1 to S10, those with visual impairments in S11 to S13, and those with hearing loss in S15. S14, S18, and S19 are for swimmers with intellectual disabilities, including Down Syndrome and autism. The system, once based on medical criteria, now focuses on functional ability to promote competitiveness.",
