Historians learned about this time from ancient books and archaeological finds at the old capital, Yinxu.\n\nExcavations revealed royal tombs, palaces, and many artifacts like bronze weapons and jade objects. The most exciting discovery was thousands of oracle bones with ancient writing. These bones were used for predicting the future and give us valuable information about early Chinese culture, politics, and even medicine.",
