	"summary": "Barbiturates are strong drugs originally made from barbituric acid. They can help with anxiety, sleep, and seizures, but they're also very dangerous. They can be addictive and easy to overdose on, with no quick fix if that happens. Most countries control them because of these risks. Now, other safer drugs like benzodiazepines are usually used instead, except for specific medical uses like anesthesia or certain headache treatments.",
