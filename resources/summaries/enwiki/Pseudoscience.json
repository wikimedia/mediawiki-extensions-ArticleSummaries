	"summary": "Phrenology, a practice from the 1800s, claimed to predict personality by examining skull bumps, but it was later proven wrong. This is an example of pseudoscience, which pretends to be scientific but isn't. Pseudoscience often makes exaggerated claims, ignores evidence, and doesn't follow scientific rules. It can be harmful, like anti-vaccine beliefs or fake medical treatments, which can make people sick. \n\nThe term is sometimes offensive because it suggests deception. It's important to spot pseudoscience to promote real science and keep people safe.",
