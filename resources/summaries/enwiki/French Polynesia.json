	"summary": "French Polynesia is a group of 121 islands in the South Pacific Ocean, belonging to France. These islands are spread out over a large area and include places like Tahiti, which is the most populated. People have lived here since the Great Polynesian Migration, and European explorers visited later. In 1842, France took control and made it a protectorate. Over time, it became an overseas territory, and then in 2003, an overseas collectivity with more local control. Today, it's known for its beautiful islands and has its own president.",
