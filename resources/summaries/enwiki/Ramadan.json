	"summary": "Ramadan is an important month for Muslims, during which they fast from dawn to sunset. It honors Muhammad's first revelation and is one of Islam's Five Pillars. Fasting is mandatory for healthy adults, lasting 29-30 days. Muslims abstain from food, drink, smoking, and sins, focusing on prayer and the Quran. The daily fast is broken with a meal called *iftar* after sunset. Those unable to fast due to health or travel reasons are exempt. The rewards for good deeds are believed to be greater during Ramadan.",
