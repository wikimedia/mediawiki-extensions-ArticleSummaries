These planes can carry between 66 and 124 passengers and are used for shorter flights. The first E-Jet flew in 2002, and they quickly became popular with airlines worldwide, especially in the United States. They are known for being efficient and offering a comfortable ride, even on shorter routes. Embraer later improved the design with the E-Jet E2 family, which uses less fuel.",
