	"summary": "Maltese is a unique language spoken in Malta. It started as a type of Arabic brought to Sicily by Muslims many centuries ago. Over time, it changed and mixed with Romance languages like Italian and Sicilian. This made Maltese different from other Arabic languages. It uses the Latin alphabet, which is unusual for a Semitic language. Today, Maltese is the official language of Malta and part of the European Union. Many words come from Italian and English, but it still has some roots in Arabic.",
