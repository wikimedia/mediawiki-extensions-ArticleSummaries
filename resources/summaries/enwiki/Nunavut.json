	"summary": "Nunavut is Canada's largest and northernmost territory, created in 1999 for the Inuit people's self-government. It's bigger than Mexico but has a small population of around 37,000, making it the least densely populated area in the world (excluding Antarctica). The capital, Iqaluit, is on Baffin Island. Nunavut includes many Arctic islands and is home to the world's northernmost permanently inhabited place, Alert. It's so remote that it's not connected to the rest of North America by road.",
