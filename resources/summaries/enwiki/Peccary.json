	"summary": "Peccaries are pig-like animals living in Central and South America, the Caribbean, and southwestern North America. They are about 3 to 4 feet long and weigh between 44 and 88 pounds. These social creatures live in groups called squadrons, typically with 6 to 9 members. Peccaries are omnivores, eating roots and insects. They first appeared in North America millions of years ago and migrated to South America later. People often confuse them with wild boars. Historically, the Maya kept peccaries for rituals and food, and they are still kept as pets and farm animals today.",
