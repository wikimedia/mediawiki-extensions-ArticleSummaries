	"summary": "Ukrainian is a language mainly spoken in Ukraine, belonging to the Indo-European family of languages. It's written using a Cyrillic alphabet. While it's often compared to Russian, it's actually closer to Belarusian, Polish, and Bulgarian in terms of understanding and word choice. Ukrainian developed from an old Slavic language spoken in the medieval state of Kievan Rus'. Despite being banned in schools during the Russian Empire and Soviet Union, Ukrainian has endured and is still widely used, especially in western Ukraine.",
