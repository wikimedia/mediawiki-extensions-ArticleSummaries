	"summary": "The Cauchy–Schwarz inequality is a math rule that helps us compare two lists of numbers (called vectors). It tells us how close these lists are to each other based on their lengths. This rule is very useful in math and is used in many different areas, like sums and integrals. It was first shown for sums by Cauchy in 1821 and later extended to integrals by Bunyakovsky and Schwarz.",
