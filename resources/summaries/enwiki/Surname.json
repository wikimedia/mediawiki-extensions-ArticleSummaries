	"summary": "A full name usually includes a given name (like John) and a surname (like Kennedy). Surnames are often hereditary, passed down in a family. They can appear at the start or end of a name, depending on culture. Some cultures use multiple surnames.\n\nSurnames have a long history, with examples from ancient times. In England, they became hereditary around the 14th century, often indicating a person's trade, father's name, or birthplace. The study of names is known as onomastics.",
