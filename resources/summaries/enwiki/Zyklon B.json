	"summary": "Zyklon B was a deadly pesticide used by Nazi Germany during the Holocaust to kill around 1.1 million people in gas chambers. It was made up of hydrogen cyanide and other chemicals. Originally developed in Germany in the 1920s, it was used to delouse clothing and fumigate buildings. The Nazis began using it in extermination camps in 1942. The main manufacturers, Tesch and Weinbacher, were executed after the war for selling it to the SS. Today, hydrogen cyanide is rarely used as a pesticide, but Zyklon B's components are still produced under different names.",
