	"summary": "Huntsman spiders, from the Sparassidae family, are fast hunters, which is where they get their name. They're also called giant crab spiders due to their size. Some are known as rain spiders or lizard-eating spiders in Africa. These spiders prefer warm, temperate to tropical climates and can be found on several continents. A few species, like the wheel spider and Cebrennus rechenbergi, move in unique ways, either cartwheeling or doing handsprings.",
