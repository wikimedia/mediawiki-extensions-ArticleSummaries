	"summary": "The One Ring, also known as Isildur's Bane, is a powerful magical ring in J.R.R. Tolkien's books. It first appeared in \"The Hobbit\" as a ring that makes the wearer invisible. Later, in \"The Lord of the Rings,\" Tolkien made it a dangerous Ring of Power. The story follows a hobbit named Frodo Baggins as he tries to destroy the ring and save the world. Some people think Tolkien was inspired by the opera \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\" and ancient mythology. Tolkien said the story isn't an allegory, but readers can see connections to real-world events.",
