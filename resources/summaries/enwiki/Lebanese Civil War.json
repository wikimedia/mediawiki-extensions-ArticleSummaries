	"summary": "The Lebanese Civil War was a complex fight between different religious and political groups in Lebanon. It started in 1975 when Christian militias fought against Palestinian and Muslim groups. The war happened because Lebanon's government was led by Christians, but many Muslims wanted more power. This led to alliances between Muslims, Palestinians, and left-wing groups against Christians. Foreign countries like Syria and Israel also got involved. The war caused many deaths and forced people to leave the country. It ended with a peace agreement in 1990, but some tensions still exist.",
