	"summary": "Texas Hold 'Em is a popular card game, a variation of poker. Each player gets two secret cards, and five community cards are placed face-up in three stages. Players aim to make the best five-card hand using any combination of these cards. Betting rounds occur before and after each card stage, with options to check, call, raise, or fold. The player with the best hand wins the pot (all the bets). It's also part of the HORSE poker game.",
