	"summary": "Reformed Christianity, or Calvinism, is a Protestant faith that started in the 1500s. It's known for its beliefs in the Bible's authority, God's power, and how God makes promises (covenants) to people. Churches follow simple worship styles and may have different leadership structures.\n\nKey figures like John Calvin shaped this tradition, mainly in Switzerland, Scotland, and the Netherlands. A big debate about salvation led to a split, creating the \"five points\" of Calvinism.",
