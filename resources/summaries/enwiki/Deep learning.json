It works by stacking layers of \"neurons\" (like the brain has) and teaching them to recognize patterns in data. The more layers, the \"deeper\" the learning.\n\nThese networks can analyze images, understand speech, translate languages, and even design new drugs! They're inspired by how the brain works, but they're not exact copies. Deep learning has achieved amazing results, sometimes even outperforming humans.",
