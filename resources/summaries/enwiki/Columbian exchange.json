	"summary": "The Columbian Exchange was a big trade between the Americas and Afro-Eurasia after Christopher Columbus' voyage in 1492. It involved plants, animals, and diseases moving between these places. Unfortunately, it also brought deadly diseases to the Americas, which greatly reduced the Indigenous population.\n\nThis exchange changed both hemispheres. European colonists and African slaves moved to the Americas. Crops like maize and potatoes went global, while rice and wheat became important in the Americas. The term was first used in 1972 by historian Alfred W. Crosby.",
