	"summary": "Anxiety is a feeling of worry and uneasiness, often about things that might happen in the future. It's different from fear, which is about immediate threats. People with anxiety might feel restless, tired, or have trouble breathing. They may also have physical symptoms like stomach aches or nausea.\n\nIf anxiety lasts for a long time, it can become an anxiety disorder. These disorders can make people avoid situations that make them anxious. They are common and can last for years if not treated.",
