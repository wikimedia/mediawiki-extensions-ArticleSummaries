	"summary": "Abortion is when a pregnancy is ended, either on purpose (induced abortion) or by accident (miscarriage). It's a safe medical procedure when done legally and by a professional. Women might choose abortion for various reasons, like health concerns, financial issues, or not wanting to be a parent.\n\nUnsafe abortions, done without proper skills or in bad conditions, can be dangerous and even deadly. About 73 million abortions happen yearly worldwide, with many being unsafe. The World Health Organization says legal and safe abortions are crucial for women's health.\n\nDifferent countries have different rules about abortion, with some allowing it and others restricting it.",
