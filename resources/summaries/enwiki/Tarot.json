	"summary": "Tarot cards are a unique deck used for games and divination. They originated in Italy during the 1400s as \"trionfi\" and later became known as tarocchi or tarocks. The deck has four suits, similar to standard playing cards, but with an extra trump suit and a special card called the Fool. These cards were popular for games like Tarocchini and spread across Europe, adapting to different cultures. Over time, some people in France started using tarot cards for fortune-telling, creating a new purpose for these cards.",
