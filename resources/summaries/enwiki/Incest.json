	"summary": "Incest is when close relatives, like brothers and sisters or cousins, have sex. It's usually seen as wrong and is against the law in many places because it can cause health problems for any children they might have. These problems happen because close relatives share a lot of the same genes, which can lead to genetic disorders. Most cultures have rules against incest, but what's considered wrong can differ. Some ancient societies, like Ancient Egypt, even had royal families who married close relatives to keep their bloodline pure.",
