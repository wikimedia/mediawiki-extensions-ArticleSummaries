	"summary": "The Darién Gap is a wild and hard-to-reach area between Panama and Colombia. It's a mix of mountains, rainforests, and rivers, making it tough to travel through. This gap breaks the Pan-American Highway, so there's no easy way to drive between the two countries.\n\nPeople who live there include the Embera-Wounaan and Guna tribes. They mostly farm, ranch, or work in the timber industry. The gap is also known for criminal activities like human and drug trafficking.\n\nDespite the dangers, many migrants use this route to reach the United States, making it a busy migration path.",
