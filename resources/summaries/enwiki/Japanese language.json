	"summary": "Japanese is the main language of Japan, with around 123 million speakers. It's part of the Japonic language family, which also includes Ryukyuan languages and Hachijō. We don't know much about its early history, but it started appearing in texts around the 8th century AD. Japanese has a unique writing system using Chinese characters (kanji), two Japanese syllabaries (hiragana and katakana), and sometimes Latin script (rōmaji). It's an agglutinative language with a subject-object-verb word order and a complex system of honorifics to show respect.",
