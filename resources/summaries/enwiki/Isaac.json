	"summary": "Isaac is a key figure in the Abrahamic religions, including Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. He was the son of Abraham and Sarah and the father of Jacob and Esau. Isaac's name means \"he will laugh,\" referring to the disbelief of his parents when God promised them a child. Unlike his father and grandfather, Isaac never changed his name and remained in Canaan. The Bible states that he lived to be 180 years old, making him the longest-lived of the three patriarchs.",
