	"summary": "Western esotericism is a term for various ideas and movements in Western culture that are different from traditional Christian beliefs and scientific thinking. It includes things like Hermeticism, Gnosticism, and occultism, which have influenced art, literature, and music. These traditions started in Late Antiquity and grew during the Renaissance, with groups like Rosicrucianism and Freemasonry. In the 19th century, new occult groups formed, and in the 1960s, these ideas became part of the counterculture, leading to the New Age movement. Scholars began studying Western esotericism seriously in the late 20th century.",
