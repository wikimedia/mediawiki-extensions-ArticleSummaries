	"summary": "The Interstate Highway System is a network of highways across the United States, named after President Dwight D. Eisenhower. It's a big project with uniform roads, unlike the older, varied U.S. Numbered Highways. Eisenhower's administration started it in 1956, and it cost a lot of money, about $114 billion. The system is over 48,000 miles long and is mostly free of traffic lights and at-grade intersections. It's funded by the federal government but owned by the states. Despite some issues, like displacing people in cities, it's a crucial part of America's transportation.",
