	"summary": "Cognac is a type of brandy from the town of Cognac, France. It's made from grapes, mostly Ugni blanc, and must be distilled twice in copper pots and aged in French oak barrels for at least two years. The longer it ages, the better the flavor. This process is similar to how whiskies and wines get their taste from aging in barrels.",
