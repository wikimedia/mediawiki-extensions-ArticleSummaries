In the Bible, God defeats Leviathan, representing God's power over chaos. The creature is linked to ancient myths, like the Mesopotamian Tiamat, and is sometimes compared to dragons or world serpents. Some scholars think it might refer to large sea creatures like crocodiles or whales. Over time, the word \"Leviathan\" has become a symbol for any huge sea monster.",
