	"summary": "Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytic theory introduces three key elements of the human mind: the id, ego, and superego. The id represents our basic instincts and desires, while the superego is our moral compass, shaped by societal norms. The ego acts as the mediator, balancing the id's impulses with reality and the superego's rules. Freud's model helps understand our thoughts and behaviors, comparing the ego to a rider controlling a horse (the id). This theory was further developed in his essays, offering insights into the complex workings of the human psyche.",
