Other symptoms include fever and headaches, lasting about a week. It's usually milder in kids but can be serious for adults.\n\nThe virus spreads easily through the air when someone coughs or sneezes, or by touching blisters. A vaccine can prevent it, and most people only get chickenpox once. Treatment includes lotion for itching and medicine for fever.",
