	"summary": "Gonorrhea is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by bacteria. It can affect both men and women and is often spread through sexual contact, including oral, anal, and vaginal sex. Symptoms may include pain or burning during urination, unusual discharge, and pelvic pain. Many people don't show any signs, though.\n\nThe condition can lead to serious complications if left untreated, such as affecting the joints or heart valves. It can be prevented by using condoms, having protected sex, or not having sexual intercourse. Testing and treatment are available, and it's essential to inform sexual partners for their well-being.",
