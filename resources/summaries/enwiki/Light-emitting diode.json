	"summary": "A light-emitting diode (LED) is a tiny light source made from a special type of material called a semiconductor. When electricity flows through it, LED emits light. The color of the light depends on the material used. First introduced in 1962, LEDs were initially low-intensity infrared lights used in remote controls. Later, visible-light LEDs were developed, and now they come in various colors and brightness levels. LEDs are used everywhere, from room lighting to traffic signals, because they use less power, last longer, and are more durable than traditional light bulbs.",
