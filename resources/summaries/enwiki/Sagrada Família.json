	"summary": "The Sagrada Família is a unique church in Barcelona, Spain, designed by architect Antoni Gaudí. Construction started in 1882 and is still ongoing. Gaudí's creative style, blending Gothic and Art Nouveau, makes it unlike any other church. It became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2005.\n\nThe project faced setbacks, including a fire during the Spanish Civil War, but construction resumed and advanced with modern technology. While the main structure is near completion, details and sculptures will continue until 2034. The church is expected to be finished in 2026, marking the 100th anniversary of Gaudí's death.",
