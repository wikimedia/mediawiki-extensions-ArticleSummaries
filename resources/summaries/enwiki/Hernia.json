	"summary": "A hernia happens when an organ or tissue sticks out of the body cavity where it's supposed to be. This commonly happens in the abdomen, especially the groin area. Hernias can cause pain, especially when coughing or exercising, and sometimes show as a bulge.\n\nThere are different types, like inguinal (groin), femoral (upper thigh), hiatus (where the food pipe meets the stomach), and umbilical (belly button).\n\nHernias can be genetic and are more common in smokers, obese people, and those who lift heavy things.  Treatment depends on the type and severity, ranging from waiting and watching to surgery.",
