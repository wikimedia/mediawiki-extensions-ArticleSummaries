	"summary": "Colorectal cancer starts in the large intestine (colon or rectum) and can cause symptoms like blood in stool, weight loss, and abdominal pain. It's often linked to lifestyle choices like eating red meat, smoking, and lack of exercise. Some people inherit genetic disorders that increase the risk.\n\nThis cancer usually develops from benign tumors (polyps) and can be diagnosed through colonoscopy and medical imaging. Screening is essential and recommended from age 45 to detect polyps before they become cancerous.\n\nTreatment options include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. Early detection improves survival chances. Globally, it's the third most common cancer, affecting over 1 million people in 2018.",
