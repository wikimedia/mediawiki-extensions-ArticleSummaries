	"summary": "African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) is a unique way of speaking English, mainly used by African Americans in urban areas. It has its own special grammar, words, and accent. People might use AAVE in casual conversations but switch to more standard English when speaking formally. AAVE is closely related to Southern American English because of the historical connection to slavery in the South. Some linguists believe it developed from non-standard English spoken by early settlers, while others think it might have started as a creole language, like those found in Africa and the Caribbean, and then changed over time.",
