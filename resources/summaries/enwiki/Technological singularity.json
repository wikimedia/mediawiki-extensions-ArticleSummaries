	"summary": "The **technological singularity** is a future time when technology might grow so fast and become so advanced that it's impossible to predict what will happen. Some people think this could lead to super-smart machines that are much smarter than humans. This idea was first talked about by mathematician John von Neumann. Writer Vernor Vinge and Ray Kurzweil made the concept more popular. Some scientists, like Stephen Hawking, worry that super-intelligent machines could be dangerous and even cause human extinction. However, not everyone agrees that this singularity will happen.",
