	"summary": "In Greek mythology, the underworld, called Hades, is a separate place where people go after they die. It's located at the Earth's edge or underground, always dark and sunny. Normally, only dead souls enter, but some heroes like Heracles and Theseus visited it. Hermes, the god of boundaries, often guides the dead there. Over time, the idea of judgment was added, where good and bad people are separated.",
