	"summary": "Vermouth is a special type of wine that's been flavored with herbs, roots, and spices. It was first made in Italy a long time ago and was used as medicine, but now it's often drunk as an appetizer or used in cocktails like martinis. There are different kinds of vermouth, like sweet, dry, and red, each with its own unique taste. It's made by adding extra alcohol and secret mixes of ingredients to regular wine. Italian and French vermouths are the most popular, but even countries like Australia and Canada make great ones now.",
