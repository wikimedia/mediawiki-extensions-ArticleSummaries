	"summary": "## Matrix\n\nA matrix is like a rectangular table of numbers, with rows and columns. Each number in the table is called an \"element.\" For example, `a2,1` is the number in the second row and first column. Matrices help mathematicians and scientists represent and solve problems involving linear equations, geometric transformations (like rotations), and more. Special types of matrices, called square matrices, have the same number of rows and columns and are important in advanced math.",
