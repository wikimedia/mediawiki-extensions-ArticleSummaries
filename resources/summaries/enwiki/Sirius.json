	"summary": "Sirius is the brightest star we see at night. Its name means 'glowing' in Greek. It's actually two stars: Sirius A, a bright, hot star, and Sirius B, a smaller, faint white dwarf star. They orbit each other every 50 years. Sirius seems extra bright because it's one of our closest stellar neighbors.\n\nIn the future, Sirius will get even brighter and become the southern Pole Star around 66,270 AD. It will stay the brightest star for about 210,000 years.  It's also known as the \"Dog Star\" because it's in the constellation Canis Major (the Big Dog).",
