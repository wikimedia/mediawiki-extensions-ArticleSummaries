	"summary": "The swastika is an ancient symbol with various meanings across different cultures. It is often associated with Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, representing concepts like the sun, prosperity, and spiritual teachers. However, its use by the Nazi Party in the 20th century has made it a powerful symbol of hatred and antisemitism in the Western world. While it remains banned in some countries due to its Nazi connection, the swastika continues to be a positive symbol of luck and spirituality in many Asian cultures.",
