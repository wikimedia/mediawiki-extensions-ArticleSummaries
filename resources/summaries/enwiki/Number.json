	"summary": "Numbers are used for counting, measuring, and labeling. The natural numbers (ℕ) are the most basic, like 1, 2, 3. We use numerals, like \"5,\" to represent them. Over time, mathematicians expanded the idea of numbers:\n\n- Integers (ℤ) include negative numbers.\n- Rational numbers (ℚ) can be fractions, like 1/2.\n- Real numbers (ℝ) include decimals, such as √2.\n- Complex numbers (ℂ) use the square root of -1.\n\nThese systems help with calculations and have cultural importance. In math, numbers are part of arithmetic and number theory.",
