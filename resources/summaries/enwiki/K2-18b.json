	"summary": "K2-18b is an exoplanet about 124 light-years away, orbiting a red dwarf star. It's a bit bigger than Earth and has a 33-day orbit in the star's habitable zone, receiving similar sunlight. Discovered by the Kepler telescope, it has water vapor, carbon dioxide, and methane in its atmosphere. Scientists think it might be more like a gas planet (like Neptune) than Earth, and they're not sure if it's a water or magma ocean planet. The James Webb Space Telescope is helping them learn more.",
