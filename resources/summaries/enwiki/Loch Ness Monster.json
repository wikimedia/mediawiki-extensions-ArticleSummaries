	"summary": "The Loch Ness Monster, or Nessie, is a famous Scottish legend. People say it lives in Loch Ness, a big lake in Scotland. It's described as a huge animal with a long neck and humps on its back. Many people have claimed to see it, but there's no real proof. Scientists think these sightings are probably just tricks of the light or people mistaking other animals for Nessie. Despite this, many still believe in the mystery of the Loch Ness Monster.",
