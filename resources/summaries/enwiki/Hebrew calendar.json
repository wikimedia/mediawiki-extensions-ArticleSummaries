	"summary": "The Hebrew calendar, also known as the Jewish calendar, is used for religious events and in Israel. It's a lunisolar calendar, meaning it follows the moon and the sun. Each month has 29 or 30 days, starting with the new moon. To match the solar year, an extra month is added every 2-3 years.\n\nOriginally, people watched the sky to mark the start of months and years. Now, we use math rules. Years are counted from the creation of the world, and the current year is 5785, starting from October 2, 2024.",
