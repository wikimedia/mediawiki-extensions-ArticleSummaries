	"summary": "Right-wing politics believes in maintaining social order and hierarchy, often through tradition, religion, or natural law. It supports inequality as a natural part of society, which can be seen in economic competition. This political view is the opposite of left-wing politics. Right-wingers include social and fiscal conservatives and right-libertarians. The terms \"right\" and \"right-wing\" can be used in both positive and negative ways to describe various conservative and neoliberal ideas.",
