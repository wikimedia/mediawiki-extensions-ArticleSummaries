	"summary": "## Roswell Incident: A Summary\n\nIn 1947, a balloon crashed in Roswell, New Mexico. The Army first said it was a \"flying disc,\" but then claimed it was just a weather balloon. In 1978, a former Air Force officer said the truth was being hidden. He thought the debris might be from space aliens. This started a big debate, with some people believing in aliens and others thinking it was a secret government project. The Air Force later explained it was a top-secret balloon used to listen for Soviet nuclear tests. Even so, some people still believe in alien connections.",
