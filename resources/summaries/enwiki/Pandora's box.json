	"summary": "In Greek mythology, Pandora's box is a famous story from Hesiod's poem. Pandora, out of curiosity, opened a jar (not a box) given to her husband, releasing all sorts of curses and troubles onto humanity. This mistake has become a popular idiom, meaning something that seems good at first but causes problems later. Over time, artists and writers have told this story in different ways, sometimes focusing more on the troubles that were released than on Pandora herself.",
