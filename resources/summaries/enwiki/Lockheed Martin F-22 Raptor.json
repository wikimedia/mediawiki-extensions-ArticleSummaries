	"summary": "The F-22 Raptor is a powerful fighter jet made by Lockheed Martin and Boeing for the U.S. Air Force. It's super fast, can fly in any weather, and is hard to detect by enemies. This plane can do many jobs, like fighting other planes, attacking ground targets, and gathering secret information. \n\nFirst tested in 1997, it entered service in 2005. The Air Force wanted to replace their old F-15s with 750 F-22s but ended up getting only 195 due to cost and other issues. The F-22 has been used in battles in the Middle East and is a key part of the Air Force until a new plane takes its place.",
