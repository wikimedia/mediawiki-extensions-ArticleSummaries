	"summary": "The sugar glider is a small, nocturnal animal that lives in trees and can \"fly\" by gliding through the air using membranes between its legs. They are named for their love of sweet foods like sap and nectar. These creatures are native to Australia and New Guinea and have soft, grey-brown fur. People often keep them as pets, but it's important to note that they are wild animals and may be protected by conservation laws.",
