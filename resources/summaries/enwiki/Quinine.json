	"summary": "Quinine is a medicine used to treat diseases like malaria and babesiosis. It can be taken by mouth or through a needle. Though it might help with leg cramps, doctors don't recommend it due to possible serious side effects like deafness and irregular heartbeat. Quinine is also found in tonic water, giving it a bitter taste.\n\nFirst discovered in 1820 from the bark of a Peruvian tree, quinine has been used to treat malaria since the 1600s. It's considered an essential medicine by the World Health Organization.",
