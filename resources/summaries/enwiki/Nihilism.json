	"summary": "Nihilism is a philosophical idea that says certain things in life, like knowledge, morality, or meaning, are not real or don't matter. It comes from the Latin word \"nihil\" meaning \"nothing.\" Some people believe that life has no purpose or that our values are not true. This concept has been talked about by many philosophers and writers. It can make people feel lost or hopeless. Nihilism can be linked to different times in history, like postmodernity, and some religious leaders also see it in modern times.",
