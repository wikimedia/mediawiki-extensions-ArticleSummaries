	"summary": "Osiris was an ancient Egyptian god with many roles, including ruling over agriculture, the afterlife, and the dead. He was often shown as a mummified king with a special crown and symbols of power. Osiris' story involves his brother Set killing and cutting him into pieces, but his wife Isis found and reassembled him, bringing him back to life. This myth is linked to nature's cycles and the belief in life after death. People worshipped Osiris from around 2500 BC, and he was especially important to kings, who hoped to be like him in the afterlife.",
