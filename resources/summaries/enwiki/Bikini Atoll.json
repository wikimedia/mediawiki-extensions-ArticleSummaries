	"summary": "Bikini Atoll, located in the Marshall Islands, is a group of 23 islands with a central lagoon. In the 1940s, the US chose it as a nuclear testing site, relocating the 167 residents. The tests continued until 1958, making the islands too dangerous to inhabit due to radiation. The islanders were moved to other islands and the US, and the atoll became a World Heritage Site. Today, it's visited by divers and scientists, but it's still not safe to live there due to contamination. The radiation is slowly decreasing, but eating local plants and wildlife is not advised.",
