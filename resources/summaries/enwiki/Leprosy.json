	"summary": "Leprosy, also called Hansen's disease, is a long-term infection caused by bacteria. It can harm nerves, the respiratory tract, skin, and eyes. People with leprosy may lose feeling in their hands and feet, leading to injuries going unnoticed and causing damage. It spreads between people through close contact, mainly by coughing or touching infected nose fluid. Poor living conditions make it more common. \n\nThere are two types: paucibacillary (mild) and multibacillary (severe). Diagnosis is made by finding specific bacteria in skin samples. Leprosy is treated with antibiotics and can be cured. It's not very contagious, and people with leprosy can live normal lives. Global efforts have reduced cases, but stigma still exists.",
