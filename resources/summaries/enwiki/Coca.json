People have grown coca for over 8,000 years for its stimulating and medicinal properties. It is a crucial part of many South American cultures and is used in spiritual and social traditions.\n\nThe plant is cultivated as a cash crop in several South American countries, even where it's illegal. Its leaves contain cocaine, ranging from 0.23% to 0.96%. Historically, Coca-Cola used an extract from these leaves, but later changed to a cocaine-free version.",
