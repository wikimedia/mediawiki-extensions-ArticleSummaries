	"summary": "The U.S. Senate is one of two parts of Congress, the other being the House of Representatives. It has 100 members, with two senators representing each state. Senators serve for six years, and their powers include confirming important appointments made by the president and approving treaties. They also try impeachment cases sent by the House.\n\nSenators were originally appointed by state legislatures, but since 1913, they've been elected by popular vote. The Senate is known for being more thoughtful and prestigious than the House, with its smaller size and longer terms. The vice president is the Senate's official leader, but they only vote in a tie.",
