	"summary": "The sable is a small mammal found in forests across Russia, Mongolia, and parts of Asia. It has soft, valuable brown fur, making it important in the fur trade for centuries. Sables look like pine martens but have longer ears and smaller tails. They are good climbers and use sound and smell to hunt. These animals usually have two or three babies at a time. Despite being hunted for their fur, sables are not considered an endangered species.",
