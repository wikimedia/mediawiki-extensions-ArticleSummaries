	"summary": "Logic is like a superpower that helps us think and argue smartly. It's all about understanding how to make good decisions and draw the right conclusions. When you use logic, you look at what you know (the premises) and figure out what you can be sure of (the conclusion). For example, if you know it's Sunday and that means no work, then you can conclude you don't have to work today.\n\nThere are different types of logic, like formal and informal, and they help in many areas, from math to computers. Ancient people like Aristotle studied logic, and we still use some of their ideas today.",
