	"summary": "A sovereign state is a country with complete control over its territory and people. It has its own government and isn't ruled by another country. To be a sovereign state, it must have a permanent population, a defined territory, and the ability to interact with other countries. Not all sovereign states are officially recognized by other countries, like Somaliland. Unrecognized states find it hard to have diplomatic relations because of this. The term \"country\" can also refer to a part of a larger nation or a territory under another country's control.",
