	"summary": "Eucalyptus is a large group of over 700 flowering plant species, mostly trees, found in Australia and some nearby islands. They are known for their unique leaves with oil glands and a \"cap\" on their flowers. The bark can vary from smooth to stringy. Eucalypts, or \"gum trees,\" are important in Australia's ecosystems, with many species adapted to wildfires. They are also grown worldwide for their fast growth, timber, and various uses, such as honey and essential oils. However, their flammability has caused concerns in some regions.",
