	"summary": "Pi (Ï€) is a special number in math that is approximately 3.14159. It is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. Pi is an irrational number, meaning it cannot be exactly written as a fraction, and its decimal form goes on forever without repeating.\n\nMathematicians have been studying pi for thousands of years. Ancient cultures like the Egyptians and Babylonians used pi for practical math. The Greek mathematician Archimedes found a way to calculate pi accurately. Over time, people have developed better methods to find more digits of pi, even using supercomputers.\n\nPi is important in many areas of math and science, especially when dealing with circles, spheres, and other curved shapes.",
