	"summary": "Midazolam, sold as Versed, is a benzodiazepine medicine used for sedation before surgery, during procedures, and to calm severe agitation. It makes people sleepy and less anxious, but doesn't fully knock them out. It can also stop long seizures. You can take it by mouth, injection, or through the nose. Side effects might include slow breathing, low blood pressure, and sleepiness. Long-term use can lead to tolerance and withdrawal. It's been used since 1982 and is considered an essential medicine by the WHO, but it's also a controlled substance in many countries.",
