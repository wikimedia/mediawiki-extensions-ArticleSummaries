It includes countries with the largest economies, both rich and poor. The G20 was started in 1999 to handle economic crises. They meet yearly, with leaders and important officials attending. In 2023, the African Union joined, making it 21 members. The G20 is now seen as a key place for global economic talks, but it's also criticized for not including all countries and having enough power to enforce decisions. People often protest during these summits.",
