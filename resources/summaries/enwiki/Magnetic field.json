	"summary": "A magnetic field, sometimes called a B-field, is an area of space where magnetic force is felt. It affects moving electric charges and materials like iron. This field is created by moving electric charges or tiny particles with spin. There are two types of magnetic fields, B and H, measured in tesla and ampere per meter, respectively. Magnetic fields are crucial in technology, such as electric motors and generators, and even help protect Earth's ozone layer. They are part of the electromagnetic force, one of nature's fundamental forces.",
