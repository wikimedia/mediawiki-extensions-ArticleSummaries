	"summary": "NPVIC is an agreement between some U.S. states and Washington, D.C., to give all their electoral votes to the presidential candidate who wins the most votes nationwide. The goal is to ensure the winner of the popular vote becomes president. As of 2024, 17 states and D.C. have joined, holding 209 electoral votes. This is close to the 270 votes needed to make the compact effective. However, there are legal questions about whether states can make this agreement without Congress's approval.",
