It was officially adopted in 1965 by Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson after a debate about having an official Canadian flag. Before this, Canada used the Canadian Red Ensign. The Union Flag is also an official flag in Canada, symbolizing its connection to the monarch and the Commonwealth. The maple leaf design is widely used by Canadian officials and military forces.",
