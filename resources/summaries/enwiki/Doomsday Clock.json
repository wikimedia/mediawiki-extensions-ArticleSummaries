	"summary": "The Doomsday Clock is a symbol showing how close we are to a global disaster caused by human actions, like nuclear war, climate change, or AI. It's not a real clock, but a way to warn us about dangers from new technologies. Scientists decide the time, with midnight meaning the world is destroyed. The clock was set in 1947 and has moved closer and farther from midnight many times. In 2023, it was the closest ever, at just 90 seconds away.",
