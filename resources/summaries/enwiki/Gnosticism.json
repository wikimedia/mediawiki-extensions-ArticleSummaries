	"summary": "Gnosticism is an ancient religious belief that started around the 1st century AD. It focuses on having secret knowledge (gnosis) about God and the universe, instead of following traditional religious rules. Gnostics thought the physical world was bad, created by a lesser god, and that true divinity was hidden. They believed in finding spiritual enlightenment to be saved.\n\nGnostic ideas were popular in early Christian groups but were later declared heretical. Many Gnostic texts were destroyed, but some were discovered in Egypt in 1945. Gnosticism has influences from Jewish, Christian, and other ancient beliefs. Some scholars debate if it should be considered a separate religion or a part of early Christianity.",
