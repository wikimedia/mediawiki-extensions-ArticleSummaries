	"summary": "Cherry blossoms, known as sakura in Japan, are the beautiful flowers of cherry trees. They have a sweet smell and are found mostly in the Northern Hemisphere, especially in Japan, where many different types grow. People love to look at these pretty pink flowers, so special cherry tree varieties have been grown for this purpose. The Japanese word \"sakura\" can mean both the tree and its flowers. Japan even sent some of these trees to the United States as a friendly gift in 1912.",
