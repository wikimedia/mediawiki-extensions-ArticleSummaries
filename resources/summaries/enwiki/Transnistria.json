	"summary": "Transnistria, a narrow strip of land between the Dniester River and Moldova-Ukraine border, is a self-declared state, though internationally recognized as part of Moldova. It formed during the Soviet Union's dissolution in 1990, fearing Moldova's potential unification with Romania. A military conflict ensued in 1992, ending with a ceasefire and the establishment of a joint commission.\n\nTransnistria functions as an independent republic with its own government, military, and currency. It has a diverse population with Russian, Moldovan, and Ukrainian citizenships. The region, along with Abkhazia and South Ossetia, is considered a \"frozen conflict\" zone, maintaining friendly ties with each other.",
