	"summary": "The Year 2000 Problem, or Y2K, was a computer issue where many programs only used the last two digits to represent years, making the year 2000 look like 1900. This could have caused major problems for computers and systems that rely on accurate dates. People were worried about a global computer crash, so companies spent a lot of money to fix the issue. In the end, not many big problems happened when the year 2000 arrived. Programmers and experts worked hard to prevent any disasters, and even in places that didn't fix their systems, there were few issues.",
