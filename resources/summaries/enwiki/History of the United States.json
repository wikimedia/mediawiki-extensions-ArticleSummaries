	"summary": "The story of the U.S. starts with ancient indigenous people. European colonization led to wars and disease, impacting Native Americans. British colonies formed along the coast, using slave labor in the South. The American Revolution (1775-1783) resulted in independence. The Constitution was written in 1789, and the Bill of Rights protected individual freedoms.\n\nThe nation expanded west, forcing Native Americans to move. Slavery became a major issue, leading to the Civil War (1861-1865) and its abolition. The U.S. grew into a global power, fighting in World Wars I and II. The Cold War followed, with the U.S. and Soviet Union as rivals. Recent history includes social reforms, economic ups and downs, and global challenges.",
