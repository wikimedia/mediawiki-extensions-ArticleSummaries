	"summary": "Animation is a way to make movies by bringing still pictures to life. Traditional animation uses hand-drawn images on clear sheets, while modern animation often uses computers to create images (CGI). There are also types like stop-motion and claymation.\n\nAnimation is different from live-action movies, but they often mix these styles. With advanced CGI, filmmakers can now add 3D animations to live-action movies, making exciting visual effects.",
