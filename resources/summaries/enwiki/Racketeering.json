	"summary": "Racketeering is a type of organized crime where people set up illegal schemes to make money repeatedly. The term was first used in 1927 to describe criminal influence in unions. It can mean forcing businesses to pay for unnecessary \"protection\" or providing illegal services like drug dealing. Over time, the definition has expanded to include any ongoing criminal operation that makes money, even if it doesn't involve force or fraud. This activity often goes untaxed because it's hidden from the government.",
