	"summary": "A military organization is how a country's army is structured to defend itself. It uses a hierarchy, like a pyramid, with bigger groups divided into smaller ones. Each level has a leader and a specific number of soldiers. Not all armed forces are military; some are paramilitary, like police forces. Even non-military groups, like rebels, might use a similar structure to stay organized. This helps them work together effectively.",
