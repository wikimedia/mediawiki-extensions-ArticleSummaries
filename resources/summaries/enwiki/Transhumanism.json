	"summary": "Transhumanism is a cool idea that wants to make humans better using future tech. It's about living longer, being smarter, and feeling happier. Some folks think we might even become \"posthuman,\" like super-powered beings from sci-fi!\n\nThis movement started with a biologist named Julian Huxley and grew with the help of a futurist who changed his name to FM-2030. They wanted to explore how tech could change us. But not everyone agrees with it; some critics say it's risky and could lead to unfair treatment of people, like old eugenics ideas.\n\nScientists and philosophers are now studying this stuff and even have a journal to discuss it.",
