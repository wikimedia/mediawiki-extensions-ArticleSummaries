	"summary": "The Toyota War happened in 1987 between Chad and Libya. It got its name from the Toyota trucks that Chad's army used. Chad fought to stop Libya's invasion and won a big victory. Libya lost many soldiers and a lot of equipment.\n\nThe war started in 1983 when Libya's leader, Muammar Gaddafi, supported a group trying to overthrow Chad's president. France helped stop Libya's advance. In 1986, when Libyan-backed rebels turned against Gaddafi, Chad's president saw a chance to take back his country. After some successful battles, Chad regained most of its northern territory. The war ended with a peace agreement, but the dispute over a small area was settled later by a court.",
