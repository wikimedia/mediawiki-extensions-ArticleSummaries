	"summary": "The term \"Moor\" was used by Europeans to describe Muslims from North Africa, Spain, and other Mediterranean areas during the Middle Ages. It doesn't refer to a specific ethnic group but was applied to Arabs, Berbers, and even European Muslims.\n\nMoors played a significant role in history, notably in the Umayyad conquest of Hispania (modern-day Spain and Portugal) in 711. This led to centuries of Muslim rule in the region, known as al-Andalus. Conflicts with Christian kingdoms, known as the Reconquista, eventually led to the end of Muslim rule in Spain in 1492.",
