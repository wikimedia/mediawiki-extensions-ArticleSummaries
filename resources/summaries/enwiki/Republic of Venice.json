	"summary": "Venice was a powerful city-state in Europe, ruling for over 1,100 years. It started as a small group of islands and grew to become a major trading and naval power. Venice controlled areas around Northeast Italy, the Adriatic Sea, and even parts of the Eastern Mediterranean. Its leaders, called doges, were elected, and the city had a complex system of councils to govern. Venice's success came from trading with the Byzantine Empire and the East, but it faced challenges from other city-states like Genoa and later from the Ottoman Empire. Napoleon's army eventually ended the Republic's rule.",
