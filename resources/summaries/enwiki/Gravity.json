	"summary": "Gravity is a force that makes things attract each other. It's the reason why things fall to the ground on Earth and why planets orbit the sun. Gravity is what makes stars and galaxies form. It's very weak compared to other forces, but it has a big impact on large objects. Albert Einstein explained gravity as the curvature of space and time caused by mass. Scientists are still trying to fully understand gravity, especially how it works with quantum mechanics.",
