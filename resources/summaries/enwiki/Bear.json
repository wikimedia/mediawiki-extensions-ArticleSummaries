	"summary": "Bears are large, stocky mammals found mostly in the Northern Hemisphere. They have strong bodies, long snouts, and shaggy fur. There are eight species, and they eat different foods, from meat to plants. Bears live alone and are good runners and swimmers. They sleep in dens during winter, sometimes for up to 100 days.\n\nHumans have hunted bears for food and fur for a long time. Today, many bear species are in danger because of habitat loss and illegal hunting. Protecting these amazing animals is essential to keep them from disappearing.",
