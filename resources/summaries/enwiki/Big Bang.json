	"summary": "The universe began with a Big Bang, a super-hot and dense state. It started expanding and continues to do so today. This idea was first suggested by scientist Georges Lema√Ætre. The expansion is evidenced by the movement of galaxies; the farther away, the faster they move apart. \n\nThe early universe was very hot, forming light elements like hydrogen. It later cooled, creating atoms and then stars and galaxies. Scientists believe there's mysterious dark matter and dark energy affecting the universe's expansion, but we don't yet fully understand these.",
