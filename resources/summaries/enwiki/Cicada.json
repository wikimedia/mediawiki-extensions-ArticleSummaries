	"summary": "Cicadas are a group of insects related to bugs and jumpy creatures like leafhoppers. There are over 3,000 known species worldwide, with most being annual cicadas, emerging every year. Some, like the Magicicada in North America, have a unique 13- or 17-year life cycle, emerging in huge numbers all at once.\n\nThese insects have big eyes, short antennae, and see-through wings. They make loud noises by buckling and unbuckling special organs called tymbals. Cicadas live in trees, feeding on sap, and lay eggs in bark. They've been around for millions of years and are even mentioned in ancient literature and art. People in some countries also eat cicadas.",
