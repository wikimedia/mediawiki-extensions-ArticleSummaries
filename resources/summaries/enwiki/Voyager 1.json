	"summary": "Voyager 1 is a space explorer sent by NASA in 1977 to explore the solar system's outskirts. It's the farthest human-made object from Earth! It visited Jupiter and Saturn, and even Titan, Saturn's big moon. Voyager 1 is now in interstellar space, beyond our sun's reach, making it the first spacecraft to do so.\n\nThe probe keeps sending data about space weather and magnetic fields. In 2017, it got a power boost, so its mission is extended. We expect Voyager 1 to keep sending messages until at least 2025, teaching us about the universe's mysteries.",
