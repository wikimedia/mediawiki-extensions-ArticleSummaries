	"summary": "Tel Aviv-Yafo, often called Tel Aviv, is the biggest city in Israel, with around 474,000 people. It's a major center for business and technology. The city was founded in 1909 by Jewish residents near the old port city of Jaffa. It was initially called Ahuzat Bayit but was later renamed Tel Aviv, inspired by a book title. Tel Aviv grew quickly and became independent from Jaffa in 1934. After Israel's independence in 1948, the two cities merged in 1950, forming Tel Aviv-Yafo. It's known for its \"White City\" with many unique buildings and popular attractions like Old Jaffa and Yarkon Park.",
