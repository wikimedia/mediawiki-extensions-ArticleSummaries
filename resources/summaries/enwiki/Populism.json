	"summary": "Populism is a political idea that focuses on helping \"the people\" and often criticizes powerful groups, called \"elites.\" It started in the late 1800s and is used to describe different politicians and movements, sometimes in a negative way. Populists believe that ordinary people are good and that leaders, like politicians and rich people, are corrupt. They may think that these elites don't care about regular folks. Populism can be on the left or right side of politics and is often mixed with other ideas like nationalism or socialism. Some people think populism can lead to bad economic problems.",
