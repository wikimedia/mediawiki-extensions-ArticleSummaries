	"summary": "Entropy is a scientific idea that describes how messy or unpredictable something is. It's used in many different areas of science, like physics, chemistry, and biology. In simple terms, it means that in any system (like a box of toys), things tend to become more disorganized over time if left alone. This is why your room might get messy if you don't tidy it! Scientists use entropy to understand how energy works and why some processes can't be undone.",
