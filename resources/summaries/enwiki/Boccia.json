	"summary": "Boccia is a fun ball game similar to bocce and bowls. The name comes from a Latin word meaning \"boss.\" It's played by people with physical disabilities, like cerebral palsy. Players throw or roll balls to get them closest to a target ball.\n\nThis sport is special because it started for people with cerebral palsy but now includes anyone with motor skill challenges. It became a Paralympic sport in 1984 and is now played in many countries worldwide. Boccia is unique as it is only played at the Paralympics and has no similar sport at the Olympics.",
