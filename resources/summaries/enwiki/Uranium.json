	"summary": "Uranium is a silvery-gray metal found in nature, with the symbol U and atomic number 92. It's unique because it decays radioactively and has different isotopes with long half-lives, helping us understand the Earth's age. The most common forms are uranium-238 and uranium-235. Uranium is dense and heavy, occurring in low amounts in soil and rocks.\n\nIt's mainly used for its nuclear properties. Uranium-235 is crucial for nuclear power and weapons due to its ability to undergo fission. Uranium-238 can be converted into plutonium-239, another fissile material. These uses have led to nuclear advancements and concerns about weapons and waste management.",
