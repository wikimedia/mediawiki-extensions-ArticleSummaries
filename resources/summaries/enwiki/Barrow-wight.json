	"summary": "Barrow-wights are scary, ghost-like creatures in J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth. They live in ancient burial mounds called barrows. In his books, a barrow-wight almost catches four hobbits. Luckily, they escape with special swords. Tolkien got the idea for these creatures from old Norse stories. Although they aren't in Peter Jackson's movies, you can find them in some video games.",
