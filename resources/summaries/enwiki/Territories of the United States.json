	"summary": "The U.S. has several territories, which are areas controlled by the federal government but not considered full states. These territories are in the Caribbean and Pacific regions. Some are inhabited, like Puerto Rico and Guam, while others are small islands with no permanent residents.\n\nUnlike states, territories don't have full sovereignty. They have limited representation in the U.S. government and people living there can't vote for the president. These areas often face economic and political challenges, with less developed infrastructure and higher poverty rates compared to U.S. states.",
