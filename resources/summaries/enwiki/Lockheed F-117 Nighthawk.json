Developed in the 1970s to counter Soviet missiles, it had a unique shape and special materials to reduce its radar signal.\n\nThe F-117 was used in several wars, including the Gulf War, where it hit many important targets. Despite its success, it was retired in 2008 because newer planes like the F-22 were available. Some F-117s are still kept flying today.",
