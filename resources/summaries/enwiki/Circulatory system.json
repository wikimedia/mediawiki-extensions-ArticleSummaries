	"summary": "The circulatory system is like your body's delivery service. It includes your heart, blood vessels, and blood. Its job is to transport nutrients, oxygen, and other important things to all parts of your body. It also helps remove waste. This system has two main parts: systemic circulation, which takes blood away from the heart, and pulmonary circulation, which brings blood back to the heart.\n\nBlood vessels come in different types: arteries, veins, and capillaries. They work together to keep blood flowing in the right direction. The lymphatic system is a helper to the circulatory system, returning extra fluid back to the blood.",
