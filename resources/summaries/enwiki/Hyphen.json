	"summary": "A hyphen (-) is a punctuation mark that joins words or separates syllables. It's not the same as a dash or the minus sign, though they might look similar. Hyphens help us write words correctly, especially when combining two words. In computer language, there are different ways to show a hyphen, like the \"hyphen-minus\" you see on keyboards. This symbol has many uses and is an important part of writing and computer coding.",
