	"summary": "Chocolate is made from roasted and ground cocoa beans. It can be a liquid, solid, or paste and is used in many foods, especially desserts like cakes and candies. The history of chocolate goes back over 5,000 years to ancient Ecuador. After fermentation, the beans are dried, roasted, and ground into cocoa mass, which can be made into chocolate liquor. This can then be separated into cocoa solids and cocoa butter.\n\nMost of the chocolate we eat today is sweet, with added sugar and often milk. It's incredibly popular worldwide and is used in various forms, from bars to hot chocolate. However, the production of cocoa involves significant ethical concerns, including child labor and slavery in West African countries like Ivory Coast and Ghana.",
