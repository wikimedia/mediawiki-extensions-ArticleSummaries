	"summary": "Döner kebab is a Turkish dish made of meat cooked on a vertical rotisserie. The meat is shaped like an inverted cone and slowly turned as it cooks. Thin slices are cut from the outside and served in a sandwich or on a plate. This cooking style inspired similar dishes in many countries. In the 1970s, Turkish immigrants popularized the döner kebab sandwich in West Berlin, often served with vegetables and sauces in pita bread or flatbread. Today, it's a well-known fast food around the world.",
