Those with high neuroticism scores may worry more, feel hopeless, and react strongly to stress. They might turn to unhealthy habits to cope. This trait is linked to mental health issues like anxiety and mood disorders.\n\nOn the other hand, people with low neuroticism scores are usually calm and handle stress well. They don't experience as many negative feelings but might not always feel lots of positive ones either. Being happy and positive is often part of being outgoing and friendly, which are different personality traits.",
