	"summary": "Kanji are Chinese characters used in Japanese writing. They were adopted during the Old Japanese period and are still widely used today. There are about 3,000 kanji in common use, each with its own meaning and often two different pronunciations. After the Meiji Restoration, Japan simplified many characters to improve literacy.\n\nThe term \"kanji\" means \"Han characters\" and refers to the same writing system used in Chinese. This system has greatly influenced Japanese culture and language since the 5th century AD. Some kanji have similar meanings and sounds in Japanese and Chinese, while others are unique to each language.",
