	"summary": "The stoat, or Eurasian ermine, is a small carnivorous mammal found in Eurasia and northern North America. It has a wide range, so it is not considered an endangered species. Stoats have luxurious fur, which has been used for centuries in royal and ceremonial garments. They were introduced to New Zealand to control rabbits but ended up harming native birds, becoming an invasive species.",
