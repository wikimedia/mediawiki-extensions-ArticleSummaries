	"summary": "Gothic boxwood miniatures are tiny, detailed Christian sculptures made in the 15th and 16th centuries in the Low Countries. They're usually carved from boxwood and feature intricate layers of reliefs, often with biblical scenes like the life of Mary or the Crucifixion of Jesus. These miniatures were precious items, likely owned by important nobles.\n\nMost are rosary beads, statuettes, or polyptychs (folding altarpieces). They were crafted with great skill, making them rare and valuable. Many are now in museums like the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.",
