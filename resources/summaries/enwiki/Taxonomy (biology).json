	"summary": "Taxonomy is the scientific way of naming, grouping, and organizing living things. It helps us understand how different organisms are related. Scientists use special ranks like kingdom, phylum, class, and species to classify them. This system is called Linnaean taxonomy, named after Carl Linnaeus, who created it.\n\nModern taxonomy uses these ranks to show how organisms have evolved over time, including both living and extinct species. It's like creating a family tree for all living things!",
