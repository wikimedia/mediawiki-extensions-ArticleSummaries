	"summary": "Animals are a diverse group of living things found all over the Earth. They come in various shapes and sizes, from tiny insects to huge whales. Animals are special because they can move, breathe oxygen, and grow from small eggs or embryos. Most animals eat plants or other animals for food. Scientists study animals to understand their behavior and how they live together in ecosystems.\n\nThere are millions of different animal species, and they have been around for a very long time, with the earliest fossils dating back to ancient periods. Humans have a close relationship with animals, using them for food, work, and companionship.",
