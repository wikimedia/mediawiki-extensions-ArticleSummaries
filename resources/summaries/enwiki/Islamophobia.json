	"summary": "**Islamophobia: Understanding the Fear and Discrimination**\n\nIslamophobia is the unfair fear or dislike of Islam and Muslims. It's like a bias or prejudice, often based on wrong ideas. People with Islamophobia might see Muslims as a threat or link them to terrorism, which isn't true. This can lead to unfair treatment, especially for Muslim women who wear headscarves.\n\nThe world has seen more Islamophobia since the Cold War ended. Reasons include media stereotypes, the \"war on terror,\" and extremist groups spreading hate online. In 2022, the UN made March 15th the \"International Day to Combat Islamophobia\" to raise awareness. Some people debate what to call this issue; others insist it's real and needs to be stopped.",
