The Zaporozhian Cossacks were infantry, while the Don Cossacks were cavalry. Living in semi-nomadic communities called hosts, they had a unique culture and self-governance.\n\nAfter facing disruptions during the Russian Revolution and World War II, Cossacks experienced a revival in the late 20th century. Many now live across the world, with Cossack organizations in several countries, preserving their cultural identity and traditions.",
