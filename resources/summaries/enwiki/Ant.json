	"summary": "Ants are social insects related to wasps and bees. They evolved from wasps during the Cretaceous period and are found almost everywhere except Antarctica and some remote islands. Colonies range from small to huge, with millions of individuals. Each colony has different types of ants, like workers, soldiers, and queens. They work together like a single living thing, called a superorganism. Ants are important in many ecosystems and cultures, helping control pests and even being used in medicine. However, some species can harm crops and invade buildings.",
