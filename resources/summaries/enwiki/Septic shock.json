	"summary": "Septic shock is a serious condition caused by an extreme response to an infection. It can lead to very low blood pressure and organ damage. People with septic shock might need medicine to raise their blood pressure and may have high blood levels of lactate, a sign of tissue stress. It's most common in children, those with weak immune systems, and older adults. In many cases, it's treated in intensive care units, and the mortality rate can be between 25% and 50%. Infections can start anywhere in the body, like the lungs or skin, and can be caused by bacteria, fungi, viruses, or parasites.",
