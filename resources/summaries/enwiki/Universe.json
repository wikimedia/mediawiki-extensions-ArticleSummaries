It started with a huge explosion (the Big Bang) about 13.8 billion years ago and has been expanding ever since.\n\nThink of the universe like a giant, expanding foam with galaxies (like our Milky Way) scattered throughout. These galaxies are made up of stars, planets, and other objects. Scientists believe that most of the universe is made up of mysterious dark matter and dark energy. There's still lots we don't know about the universe, like how big it really is or what happened before the Big Bang.",
