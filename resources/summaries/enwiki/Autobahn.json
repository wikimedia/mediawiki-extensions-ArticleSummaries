	"summary": "The Autobahn is Germany's network of highways, known for its high-speed limits. It has a total length of 13,000 km (8,100 mi) and is officially called Bundesautobahn. While some parts have speed limits, many stretches allow drivers to go as fast as they want. However, an advisory speed limit of 130 km/h (81 mph) is recommended. In 2015, most of the Autobahn had this advisory limit, with only a small percentage having temporary or permanent speed restrictions.",
