	"summary": "A Faraday cage is a special enclosure that blocks out some types of electrical signals. It's named after scientist Michael Faraday, who made one in 1836. These cages are used to protect things like computers and medical equipment from outside electrical interference, like lightning strikes or radio waves. They work by redistributing electricity around the outside of the cage, keeping it from getting inside. However, they don't block all magnetic fields, like the Earth's. The effectiveness of a Faraday cage depends on its material and size of any holes.",
