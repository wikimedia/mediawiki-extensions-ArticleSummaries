	"summary": "Suriname, officially the Republic of Suriname, is a small South American country near the equator. It's known for its dense rainforests, covering over 90% of its territory. With a population of around 612,985, it's the least populated country in South America. The capital, Paramaribo, is home to half its people.\n\nOnce home to indigenous groups, Suriname became a Dutch colony in the 17th century, relying on slave labor for sugar plantations. It gained independence in 1975 but still shares close ties with the Netherlands. Today, Suriname is a multicultural society, with Dutch as the official language and Sranan Tongo as a common creole language. Its economy depends on resources like bauxite, gold, and oil.",
