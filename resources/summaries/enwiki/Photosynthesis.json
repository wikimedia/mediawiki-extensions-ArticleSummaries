	"summary": "## Photosynthesis: An Overview\n\nPhotosynthesis is how plants, algae, and some bacteria make food. They use sunlight to turn water and carbon dioxide into sugar for energy and release oxygen as a byproduct. This process is crucial for life on Earth as it provides oxygen and food.\n\nPlants use a system called the Calvin cycle to make sugars. Some bacteria use different methods. The first photosynthetic organisms likely used hydrogen or hydrogen sulfide instead of water.",
