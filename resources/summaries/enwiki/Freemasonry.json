	"summary": "Freemasonry is a group with a long history, dating back to stonemason guilds in the 14th century. It's like a big club for men who believe in a higher power and want to learn about morality and symbols. There are different groups, like Regular Freemasonry (with rules about religion) and Continental Freemasonry (with fewer rules). They meet in local lodges and are led by Grand Lodges.\n\nMembers go through three levels, or \"degrees,\" learning secrets and symbols. After that, they can join other special groups. Some religions and countries don't like Freemasonry, but it's still found worldwide.",
