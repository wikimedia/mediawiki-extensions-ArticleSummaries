	"summary": "A rhinoceros, or rhino, is a large mammal with one or two horns on its nose. There are five types of rhinos alive today, found in Africa and Asia. They are among the biggest animals on Earth, weighing over 2000 pounds as adults. Rhinos eat plants and have small brains. Their skin is thick and protective.\n\nRhinos are in danger because poachers hunt them for their horns, which are sold illegally. People use the horns in some traditional medicines, even though there is no proof they work. This has made most rhino species rare and at risk of extinction.",
