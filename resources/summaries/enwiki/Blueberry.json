	"summary": "Blueberries are a type of flowering plant that produces blue or purple berries. They grow as shrubs and can vary in height from a few inches to over ten feet. There are two main types: lowbush (wild) and highbush (cultivated). Lowbush blueberries are smaller and grow closer to the ground, while highbush blueberries are larger and grow on taller bushes. North America is home to all commercial blueberry species, and Canada is the top producer of lowbush blueberries, while the United States grows about 40% of the world's highbush blueberries.",
