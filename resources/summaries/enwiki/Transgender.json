	"summary": "A transgender person is someone whose true gender is different from the gender they were assigned at birth. For example, they might be born with male body parts but feel they are a girl, or vice versa. Some transgender people, or 'trans' people, choose to change their bodies with medical help to match their true gender. Being trans is not about who they are attracted to; it's about who they are. It's important to respect and support trans people, as they often face discrimination and might need help with their journey.",
