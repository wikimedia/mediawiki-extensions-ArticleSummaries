	"summary": "Vertigo is a feeling that you or things around you are moving when they're not. It often feels like spinning or swaying and can come with nausea, vomiting, or trouble walking. Common causes include inner ear problems like BPPV or Ménière's disease. Less common causes include stroke or brain injury. Vertigo can also happen after being exposed to motion for a long time. About 5% of people experience vertigo in a given year, and it's more common in women and as people get older.",
