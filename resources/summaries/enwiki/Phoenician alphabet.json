	"summary": "The Phoenician alphabet, one of the first alphabets, was used in the Mediterranean region around 1000 BC. It was a major innovation, introducing the concept of writing from right to left. This alphabet evolved from ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs. Phoenician was used to write several languages, including Hebrew and Aramaic. It spread widely due to Phoenician traders and influenced many other writing systems, such as the Greek alphabet. With 22 consonant letters, vowels were not explicitly written but later added using \"matres lectionis.\"",
