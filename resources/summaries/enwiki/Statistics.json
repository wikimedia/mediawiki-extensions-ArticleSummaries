	"summary": "Statistics is a field that helps us understand data. It involves collecting, organizing, and analyzing information to make sense of it. This can be done for various groups, like people in a country or atoms in a crystal.\n\nThere are two main ways to analyze data:\n\n1. **Descriptive Statistics**: This summarizes data using values like the average (mean) or how spread out the data is (standard deviation).\n\n2. **Inferential Statistics**: This helps us draw conclusions from data that might change randomly, like due to errors or sampling differences.\n\nStatisticians use these methods to test ideas (hypotheses) about data relationships and to avoid errors in their findings.",
