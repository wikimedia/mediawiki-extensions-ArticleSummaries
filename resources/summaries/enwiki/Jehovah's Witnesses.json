	"summary": "Jehovah's Witnesses is a Christian group with around 8.6 million members worldwide. They believe that the world is ending soon and that God's kingdom will solve all problems. The religion started in the 1870s in the United States and was originally called the Bible Student movement. They are known for going door-to-door to preach and distribute magazines like *The Watchtower*. Witnesses have unique beliefs, such as refusing blood transfusions and not celebrating holidays like Christmas. They follow the Governing Body, which makes all the rules, and they avoid socializing with people who leave the religion.",
