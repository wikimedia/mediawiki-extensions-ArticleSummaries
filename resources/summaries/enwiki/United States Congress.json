	"summary": "The U.S. Congress is like the country's law-making team, split into two groups: the House of Representatives and the Senate. There are 435 Representatives, each representing a different area, and 100 Senators, with two from each state. They all work together to make and change laws. Congress meets in Washington, D.C., and elections are held every two years. To be a part of Congress, you must be at least 25 years old for the House and 30 for the Senate, and you need to be a U.S. citizen for a certain number of years.",
