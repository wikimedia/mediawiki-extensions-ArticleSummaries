	"summary": "Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that can harm the optic nerve, leading to vision loss. It's often linked to high eye pressure. There are two main types: open-angle and closed-angle glaucoma. Open-angle glaucoma develops slowly, while closed-angle glaucoma can cause sudden, intense eye pain.\n\nEarly treatment is crucial to prevent vision loss. Regular eye checks, especially after age 40, can detect glaucoma early. Treatment options include eye drops, medication, laser therapy, or surgery, all aiming to reduce eye pressure. Glaucoma is a significant cause of blindness, particularly in certain ethnic groups.",
