	"summary": "Hokkaido is Japan's second-largest island and a prefecture. It's separated from the main island, Honshu, by the Tsugaru Strait. Sapporo, the capital, is the biggest city. The island is cold, with lots of snow, but it's great for farming.\n\nOnce known as Ezo, it was home to the Ainu people. After Japan's Meiji Restoration (1869), the island was annexed and colonized, leading to the Ainu's assimilation into Japanese culture. Today, their heritage is mostly unknown among Japanese of Ainu descent.",
