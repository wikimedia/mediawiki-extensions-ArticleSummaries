	"summary": "A stroke is a serious medical condition caused by a lack of blood flow to the brain, leading to cell death. There are two main types: ischemic (blocked blood vessel) and hemorrhagic (bleeding in the brain). Symptoms include weakness, speech problems, and vision loss on one side of the body. High blood pressure is the biggest risk factor. Diagnosis involves medical exams and imaging. Treatment depends on the type of stroke; medication can help with ischemic strokes if given quickly. Prevention includes managing risk factors like blood pressure and cholesterol. Strokes are common and a leading cause of death worldwide.",
