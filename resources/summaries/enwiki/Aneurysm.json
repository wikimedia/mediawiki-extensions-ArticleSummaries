	"summary": "An aneurysm is like a bubble on a blood vessel, caused by a weak spot in its wall. It can be hereditary or caused by a disease. Aneurysms can lead to blood clots and serious bleeding if they rupture. They can happen in any blood vessel, but some are more dangerous, like those in the brain or aorta (a major blood vessel). Even the heart can develop aneurysms after a heart attack.",
