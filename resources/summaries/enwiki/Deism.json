	"summary": "Deism is a way of thinking about God and religion. It believes in a God who created the universe but doesn't interfere with it afterward. Deists use reason and observations of nature to understand God, instead of relying on religious texts or revelations. This idea became popular during the Age of Enlightenment when people started questioning traditional religions. Deism was especially influential in the 1700s but has continued to have followers even today, with some modern variations.",
