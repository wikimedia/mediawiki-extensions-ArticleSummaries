	"summary": "Guy Fawkes Night, celebrated on November 5th, mainly in Britain, commemorates the failure of the Gunpowder Plot in 1605. This was an attempt by Catholic plotters, including Guy Fawkes, to blow up the Protestant King James I and Parliament. People celebrated the king's survival with bonfires and fireworks. Over time, the day became known as Guy Fawkes Day, and children would beg for money with his effigy. Though initially anti-Catholic, the day is now a fun social event, often celebrated at organized displays. It was also once celebrated in some North American colonies as Pope Day.",
