	"summary": "Wasabi is a spicy green paste often served with sushi. It comes from a plant native to Japan, related to horseradish and mustard. The plant grows in mountain river valleys and its rhizomes (underground stems) are grated into a paste. Wasabi has a unique, strong flavor that stimulates the nose more than the tongue. It has been used in Japan since the 8th century and has become popular worldwide, especially with sushi. Due to its limited growth and high price, a similar-tasting horseradish is often used instead in Western countries.",
