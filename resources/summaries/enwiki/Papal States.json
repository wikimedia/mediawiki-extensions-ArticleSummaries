	"summary": "The Papal States were lands in Italy ruled by the Pope from the 8th century to 1870. They were formed when the Frankish king Pepin the Short gave Pope Stephen II land that was once held by the Lombards. Over time, the Papal States grew, and the Pope became a powerful ruler in Italy during the Renaissance. At their largest, they covered parts of modern-day Italy, including Rome. However, by 1870, Italy had taken over these lands, leaving only Rome and the Vatican City under the Pope's control.",
