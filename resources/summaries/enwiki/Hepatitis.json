	"summary": "Hepatitis is when your liver gets swollen. You might not feel anything, or you could have yellow skin, feel tired, or have stomach pain. It can be acute (go away quickly) or chronic (last a long time). Hepatitis is often caused by viruses, like hepatitis A, B, or C, but it can also be from drinking too much alcohol or certain medicines.\n\nYou can get a vaccine to prevent some types. For others, treatment with medicines might help. If the liver is very damaged, a transplant might be needed. Many people worldwide have hepatitis, and it can be serious if not treated.",
