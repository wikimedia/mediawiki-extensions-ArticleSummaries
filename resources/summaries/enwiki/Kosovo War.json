	"summary": "The Kosovo War (1998-1999) was a conflict between Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), an Albanian separatist group. The KLA fought for Kosovo's independence due to discrimination and political repression by Serbian leader Slobodan Milošević.\n\nYugoslav forces responded to KLA attacks with a violent campaign, killing civilians and displacing many Albanians. NATO intervened with air strikes in March 1999, aiming to stop the violence. The war ended with a peace agreement, and NATO forces entered Kosovo.\n\nThe war caused many deaths and displacements. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia convicted leaders from both sides for war crimes.",
