	"summary": "Down syndrome is a genetic condition where a person has an extra copy of chromosome 21. This causes developmental delays, learning challenges, and distinct physical features. It's usually random, but the risk increases with the mother's age. There are different types, including Mosaic Down syndrome.\n\nDoctors can identify it during pregnancy or after birth through tests. There's no cure, but education and support improve quality of life. People with Down syndrome can go to regular schools and some even attend college. Many can do paid work as adults. Life expectancy is around 50-60 years with proper care. It's a common chromosomal condition, affecting about 1 in 700 babies in the US.",
