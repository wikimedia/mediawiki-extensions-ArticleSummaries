	"summary": "Proxima Centauri b, or Proxima b, is an exoplanet near our Sun's closest star, Proxima Centauri. It's about 4.2 light-years away in the constellation Centaurus. This planet orbits its star in about 11 days and might be similar to Earth in size and temperature. However, we don't know if it has an atmosphere, which is crucial for life as we know it. Proxima Centauri is a flare star, which could make it hard for a planet to keep an atmosphere. Discovered in 2016, Proxima b is the closest known exoplanet to our Solar System and has sparked a lot of interest in exploring the Alpha Centauri star system.",
