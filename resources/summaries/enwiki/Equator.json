	"summary": "The Equator is an imaginary line on Earth, located at 0 degrees latitude, dividing it into the Northern and Southern hemispheres. It's about 40,075 km long and equidistant from the North and South poles. This line is important in astronomy and geography. On the Equator, the sun appears directly overhead, making daytime temperatures pretty consistent throughout the year. The Equator also plays a role in how day and night are divided during the equinoxes.",
