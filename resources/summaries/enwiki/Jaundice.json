	"summary": "Jaundice is when your skin and eyes look yellow or green. It happens because of too much bilirubin, a yellow substance made when red blood cells break down. In adults, jaundice is usually a sign of a serious health problem like liver disease or a blocked bile duct. Babies often get jaundice, but it usually goes away on its own. Treatment depends on the cause. It might include medicine, surgery, or special lights for babies.",
