	"summary": "Germany became a unified nation in the 19th century, after many German-speaking states joined together. This process started in 1866 when the North German Confederation was formed, led by Prussia. Later, in 1871, most of the southern German states joined, creating the German Empire with 25 member states.\n\nPeople wanted to unite because they shared language and culture. Prussia's strength and military successes also played a big role. The unification solved the problem of having two powerful German states, Austria and Prussia, by creating a new country without Austria. This new Germany has changed over time but still exists today as the Federal Republic of Germany.",
