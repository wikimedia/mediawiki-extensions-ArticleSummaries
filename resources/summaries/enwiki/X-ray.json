	"summary": "X-rays are a type of high-energy radiation discovered by scientist Wilhelm RÃ¶ntgen. They have shorter wavelengths than ultraviolet rays and longer than gamma rays, typically ranging from 10 nanometers to 10 picometers. X-rays can pass through many solid materials, like bones and construction materials, which is why they're commonly used in medical imaging to check for broken bones or in material science to identify elements and material weaknesses. However, because they're ionizing radiation, exposure to high intensities can be harmful, causing health issues like DNA damage and cancer. Their use is strictly regulated by health authorities.",
