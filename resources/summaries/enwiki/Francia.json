	"summary": "The Kingdom of the Franks was a powerful Germanic kingdom in Western Europe during the Early Middle Ages. It was ruled by the Merovingian and Carolingian dynasties. The Franks originally lived near the Rhine and Meuse rivers, but they expanded their territory to include parts of modern-day France. Clovis I united the Franks and founded the Merovingian dynasty. Later, the Carolingian dynasty took over, with Charlemagne being the most famous ruler.\n\nThe kingdom was divided into smaller kingdoms, often in conflict. Over time, these lands became West Francia (France) and East Francia (Germany). Both nations later formed larger empires, with the Franks' legacy seen as a Pan-European symbol.",
