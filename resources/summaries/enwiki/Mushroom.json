	"summary": "Mushrooms are the fruity parts of fungi, often seen above ground. They come in various shapes and colors. The most common type has a stem, a cap, and gills underneath. These gills release tiny spores, helping the fungus spread.\n\nThe term \"mushroom\" usually refers to edible fungi like the white button mushroom. But it can also describe other similar fungi, even without stems. Some unique mushrooms have special names, like \"puffball\" or \"morel.\" The word can also mean the whole fungus or its parts.",
