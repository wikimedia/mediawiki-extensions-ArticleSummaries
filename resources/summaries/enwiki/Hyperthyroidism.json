	"summary": "Hyperthyroidism, or overactive thyroid, happens when your thyroid gland makes too many hormones. Thyrotoxicosis is a similar condition with extra thyroid hormones, but it can come from other sources. Symptoms can include nervousness, muscle weakness, fast heart rate, and weight loss.\n\nThe most common cause is Graves' disease, but it can also be due to nodules on the thyroid, inflammation, or even too much iodine. Diagnosis involves blood tests and sometimes scans. Treatment options are radioiodine therapy, medicines, or surgery, depending on the cause and severity. Hyperthyroidism affects about 1-2.5% of adults, mostly women, typically between ages 20-50.",
