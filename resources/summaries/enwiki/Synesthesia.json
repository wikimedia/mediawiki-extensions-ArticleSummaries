	"summary": "Synesthesia is a cool phenomenon where your senses mix up! Some people with synesthesia see colors when they hear music or taste flavors when they read words. For example, they might see the letter 'A' as red or hear a sound and think of a specific shape. This happens because their brain connects different senses together. It's like having a secret, colorful world that only they can experience. Scientists think it might start when we're kids, as we learn new things.",
