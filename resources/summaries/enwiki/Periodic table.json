	"summary": "The periodic table organizes all the chemical elements. It has rows (periods) and columns (groups). Elements in the same group have similar properties. Metals are usually on the left, and non-metals on the right. The table was first made by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869. It has been updated over time as new elements are discovered. Scientists keep adding more rows to the table as they find heavier elements. There are now 118 known elements, but the table might get even bigger!",
