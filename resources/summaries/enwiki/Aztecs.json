	"summary": "The Aztecs were a powerful civilization in central Mexico from the 1300s to 1521. They were a group of different ethnic tribes, mainly speaking Nahuatl. The Aztec Empire began in 1427 when three city-states (Tenochtitlan, Tetzcoco, and Tlacopan) formed an alliance. They conquered many other city-states, expanding their rule across Mesoamerica.\n\nAztec culture had unique traits like their god Huitzilopochtli and twin pyramids. They also had a complex calendar system. The empire's power peaked in 1519, but it soon fell to Spanish conquistadors led by Hernán Cortés. After the conquest, the Spanish used the existing city-states to rule over the indigenous people. Aztec history is known through archaeological finds, written records, and accounts by Spanish explorers.",
