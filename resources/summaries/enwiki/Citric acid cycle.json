	"summary": "## Citric Acid Cycle: Powering Your Cells\n\nOur bodies use a process called the citric acid cycle (or Krebs cycle) to turn food into energy. It's like a tiny power plant inside our cells! This cycle takes simple molecules from the food we eat and breaks them down, releasing energy.\n\nThis energy is stored in molecules called ATP, which our cells use like batteries to power all their activities. The cycle also makes building blocks for important molecules, like proteins. It happens in different parts of cells depending on whether they have a nucleus or not.",
