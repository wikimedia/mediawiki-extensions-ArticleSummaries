	"summary": "Wicca is a nature-based religion started in England in the 1950s by Gerald Gardner. It's a mix of old pagan ideas and new ones. Wiccans believe in two main gods: the Goddess and the God. They have special rituals for the full moon (called Esbats) and seasonal festivals (called Sabbats). The \"Wiccan Rede\" is their guide to being good and using magic. There are many different Wiccan groups, each with its own style, but they all share these basic beliefs.",
