	"summary": "## Chicxulub Crater\n\nThe Chicxulub crater is a huge impact crater under Mexico's Yucat√°n Peninsula. About 66 million years ago, an asteroid around 6 miles wide hit Earth, creating a crater 120 miles wide and 1 mile deep. It's the second largest known impact crater on Earth.\n\nScientists discovered it in the 1970s while searching for oil. They found evidence like shocked quartz and tektites, proving it was formed by a massive impact. This event happened around the same time as the mass extinction of dinosaurs and many other species. Many scientists believe the crater's formation led to the climate changes that caused this extinction.",
