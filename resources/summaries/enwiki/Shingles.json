	"summary": "Shingles is a painful skin rash caused by the same virus as chickenpox. It appears as blisters in a specific area, often on one side of the body. Before the rash, you might feel tingling or pain. Other symptoms include fever and tiredness. Shingles usually goes away in a few weeks, but some people get long-term nerve pain.\n\nAnyone who had chickenpox can get shingles later in life. It's more common in older people, but kids can get it too. Vaccines can prevent shingles, and medicine can make it less severe.",
