	"summary": "Northern Ireland is a part of the United Kingdom, located in the northeast of Ireland. It's home to around 1.9 million people and has a complex history. In 1921, Ireland was divided, creating Northern Ireland with a mostly Protestant, unionist population who wanted to stay in the UK. This led to violence and a long conflict called the Troubles, lasting until the 1990s. Today, Northern Ireland has its own government for some matters, while other areas are managed by the UK government. The economy has improved since the peace agreement, with unemployment rates similar to the rest of the UK.",
