	"summary": "Rhubarb is a plant whose stalk (not the leaves) is used in cooking. It has a sour taste and is often used in desserts like pies and crumbles. The plant grows from underground stems and has large, triangular leaves that are poisonous due to high levels of oxalic acid. Rhubarb was first used for medicine but is now grown for food. It's a hybrid of different species, making its exact origin hard to trace. Despite being a vegetable, rhubarb is often treated like a fruit in recipes.",
