	"summary": "Misanthropy is when someone dislikes or distrusts people and their behavior. Misanthropes think humans have big flaws, like being cruel, selfish, or unfair. They believe these flaws are in most people and can't be easily fixed. Some misanthropes get angry and want to hurt others, while others just want to be alone.\n\nSome smart people throughout history, like philosophers and writers, have had misanthropic views. They've written about how humans can be bad and make the world worse. But not everyone agrees with misanthropy. Some say it's too negative and ignores the good things people do.",
