	"summary": "Tungsten, also known as wolfram, is a rare metal with the symbol W and atomic number 74. First discovered in 1781, it's famous for having the highest melting and boiling points of any element. It's very dense and hard, making it difficult to shape but useful in strong alloys. Tungsten is used in light bulbs, X-ray machines, and special steels. It's also found in some bacteria and archaea, but can be toxic to animals.",
