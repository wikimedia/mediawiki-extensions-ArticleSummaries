	"summary": "Long COVID is when people have health issues that keep affecting them weeks, months, or even years after having COVID-19. Symptoms can come and go and include feeling very tired, memory problems, and trouble breathing. Doctors aren't sure what causes it, but it might be linked to organ damage, blood issues, or how the brain works.\n\nIt's hard to know how many people get long COVID, but it's thought to be between 5% and 50% of those infected. There's no special treatment, and doctors help patients manage their symptoms. Rest and pacing activities can help with some symptoms. Many people feel better over time, but some may have lifelong issues.",
