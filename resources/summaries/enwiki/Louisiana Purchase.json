	"summary": "The Louisiana Purchase in 1803 was when the United States bought a huge piece of land from France for $15 million. This area, about 828,000 square miles, is now part of the central U.S. France had controlled it before but wanted to sell to focus on other colonies. President Thomas Jefferson wanted New Orleans, but ended up buying the whole territory. This doubled the size of the U.S. The land included parts of what are now 15 states and two Canadian provinces. At the time, only about 60,000 people lived there, half of whom were enslaved.",
