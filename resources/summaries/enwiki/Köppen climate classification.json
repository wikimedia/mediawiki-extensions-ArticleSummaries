	"summary": "The Köppen climate classification is a popular system for categorizing climates worldwide. Created by Wladimir Köppen in 1884, it's like a map that groups climates into five main types: tropical (A), arid (B), temperate (C), continental (D), and polar (E). Each group is further divided based on rainfall and temperature. For example, Af is a tropical rainforest climate, while Cfb is an oceanic climate with mild summers. This system helps us understand the plants and ecosystems in different regions and predict future changes. It's often used in maps and studies about the environment.",
