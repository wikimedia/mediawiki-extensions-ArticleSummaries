	"summary": "A storm surge is a sudden rise in sea level caused by powerful winds from storms like cyclones. It's not a wave but a rapid increase in water height. Storm surges can be very dangerous for coastal areas. Things like shallow water, wind direction, and low atmospheric pressure can make them worse. As climate change causes more intense storms and higher sea levels, storm surges could become a bigger threat. To stay safe, we can build barriers, protect natural barriers like dunes, improve building standards, and have good warning systems in place.",
