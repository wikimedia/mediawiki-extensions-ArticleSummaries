	"summary": "Moose are the tallest and heaviest deer in the world, found in forests across the Northern Hemisphere. They have unique, palm-shaped antlers. These animals were important food sources for many ancient tribes. Today, their range is smaller due to hunting and habitat loss, but they've been reintroduced to some areas. Moose eat plants, both on land and in water, and are usually solitary. They can be aggressive if threatened and move quickly when needed. During mating season, male moose compete energetically for females.",
