	"summary": "A cigarette is a small, rolled tube of paper filled with tobacco. When lit, the smoker inhales the smoke from the opposite end. It's the most common way to consume tobacco. Cigarettes are harmful; they cause serious health issues like cancer, heart disease, and lung problems. Nicotine, found in tobacco, is highly addictive.\n\nModern cigarettes often have filters, but these don't make them safe. Smoking cuts lives short, with about half of smokers dying from tobacco-related diseases. To reduce smoking, many places have banned it in public areas and raised the legal purchase age.\n\nElectronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes or vapes) are a newer alternative. They heat a liquid (often with nicotine) to create vapor, instead of burning tobacco. While seen as less harmful than regular cigarettes, their long-term effects are still unknown.",
