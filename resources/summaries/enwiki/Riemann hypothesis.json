	"summary": "## The Riemann Hypothesis: A Simplifed Explanation\n\nThe Riemann Hypothesis is a big math problem about a special function called the Riemann zeta function. This function has some known \"zeros\" (places where the result is zero). The hypothesis guesses where the other zeros are located.\n\nIt says they should all be on a specific line in a kind of number chart called the complex plane.  Solving this problem would help us understand prime numbers better. It's so important that a math organization is offering a big prize ($1 million!) to anyone who can prove it right or wrong.",
