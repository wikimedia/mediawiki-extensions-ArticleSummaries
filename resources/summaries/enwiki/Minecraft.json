It's like having a virtual Lego world! The game has two main modes: survive against monsters or create without limits.\n\nFirst made in 2011, Minecraft has become the best-selling game ever, with over 300 million copies sold. It's on phones, tablets, and game consoles. Microsoft bought the game in 2014 for a lot of money. People love it so much that they make their own add-ons, like new maps and characters. There are even Minecraft conventions and a movie coming soon!",
