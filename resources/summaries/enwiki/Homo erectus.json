	"summary": "*Homo erectus* is an ancient human species that lived about 2 million years ago. They were among the earliest *Homo* species and spread across Eurasia. *H. erectus* had modern body features, like a flat face and less body hair. They were skilled hunters, using tools and possibly fire. This species is linked to the development of art and seafaring, though these claims are debated.\n\n*H. erectus* had varying brain sizes and may have cared for their young less than modern humans. They were likely monogamous, with males and females of similar size. The last *H. erectus* populations lived around 100,000 years ago in Java.",
