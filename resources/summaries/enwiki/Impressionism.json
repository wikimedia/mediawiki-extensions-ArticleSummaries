	"summary": "Impressionism was an art movement in the 1800s. Artists used small, quick brushstrokes to capture the look of light and movement. They painted everyday scenes and nature, often from unique angles. The style started in Paris, France, with artists like Claude Monet. People didn't like it at first, but the name \"Impressionism\" came from one of Monet's paintings. Soon, this style spread to music and writing, too.",
