	"summary": "## Fractals: Infinite Complexity in Small Spaces\n\nFractals are unique shapes that look similar at different sizes. Think of them as infinitely detailed patterns, like the Mandelbrot Set. Unlike regular shapes, fractals have a \"fractal dimension\" that describes how they fill space, often between whole numbers. This means they're super complex and can look different at every zoom level.\n\nThey're found in nature (like trees and coastlines) and used in computer graphics and art.  Mathematicians still debate the exact definition, but fractals show us the beauty of infinity in tiny things.",
