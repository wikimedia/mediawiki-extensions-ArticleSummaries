	"summary": "The Maillard reaction is a chemical process named after French chemist Louis Camille Maillard. It happens when amino acids and sugars react at high temperatures (around 280-330Â°F), turning food golden-brown and giving it a unique flavor. This is why bread crusts, seared steaks, and toasted marshmallows have that delicious brown color. The reaction is common in cooking and is even used to create artificial flavors. However, it can also produce a possible carcinogen called acrylamide, so it's important to control the cooking temperature.",
