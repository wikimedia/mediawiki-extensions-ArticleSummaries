	"summary": "Djibouti, a small country in Africa, is located near the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. It was once part of an ancient region called the Land of Punt. The French arrived in the late 1800s and established a colony, which later became known as the French Territory of the Afars and the Issas. Djibouti gained independence in 1977 and joined the United Nations.\n\nThe country has a mix of different ethnic groups, with Somalis and Afars being the largest. Most people (94%) follow Islam. Djibouti is important because it controls a major shipping route and serves as a port for Ethiopia. It also hosts several foreign military bases.",
