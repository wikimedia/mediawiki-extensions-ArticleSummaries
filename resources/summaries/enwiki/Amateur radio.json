People with amateur radio licenses can talk to friends near and far, even in other countries!\n\nThe International Telecommunication Union (ITU) sets rules for this hobby, and each country has its own way of giving out licenses. Radio amateurs get special frequencies to use, and they can try out different ways to send messages. It's a global community with over two million people worldwide, all connected by radio waves!",
