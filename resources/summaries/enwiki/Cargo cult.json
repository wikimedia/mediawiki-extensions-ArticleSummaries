	"summary": "Cargo cults were religious and political groups that formed in Melanesia after Western colonization. They believed that their ancestors would return with lots of food and goods. These groups often had leaders who predicted big changes, like a utopia for their followers. To make these predictions come true, they would perform rituals, like dancing or copying colonialists' actions. Most wanted Western things, but some did not. Anthropologists think these cults came from Melanesian traditions and were a reaction to colonial rule. The term \"cargo cult\" is now rarely used by experts because it can be seen as prejudiced and doesn't fully describe these complex movements.",
