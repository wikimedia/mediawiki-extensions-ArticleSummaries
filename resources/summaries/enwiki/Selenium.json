	"summary": "Selenium (Se) is a chemical element with the atomic number 34. Discovered in 1817, it's rarely found in its pure form in nature but is often found in metal sulfide ores. Selenium has different looks, from a red powder to a black solid. It's used in glassmaking, pigments, and as a semiconductor in some electronics. A little selenium is good for living things, but too much can be poisonous. It's added to some vitamins and supplements because our bodies need a tiny bit of it to work properly.",
