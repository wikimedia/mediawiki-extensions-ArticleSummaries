Cuttlefish have big eyes, eight arms, and two long tentacles with sticky suckers to catch prey like crabs and fish. They grow up to 20 inches long and weigh over 20 pounds. Dolphins, sharks, and seabirds hunt cuttlefish, which live for about 1-2 years. Cuttlefish are very smart for invertebrates and have large brains for their size.
