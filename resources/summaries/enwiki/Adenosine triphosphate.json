	"summary": "ATP is like a power pack for your body's cells. It provides energy for many important tasks, such as making your muscles move and sending signals through your nerves. You can think of it as the body's energy currency.\n\nWhen ATP is used up, it turns into ADP or AMP, but your body can also make more ATP. It's also needed to build DNA and RNA, which are like the body's instruction manuals. ATP is made up of three parts: adenine (a base), ribose (a sugar), and three phosphate groups.",
