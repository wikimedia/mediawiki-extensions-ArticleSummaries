	"summary": "The Voynich manuscript is a super old book from the 15th century, written in a mysterious language called Voynichese. It's full of cool drawings of strange plants, people, and stars. No one knows who wrote it or why. Some think it's a secret code, while others believe it might be a hoax. It's named after Wilfrid Voynich, who bought it in 1912. Many smart people have tried to crack the code, but no one has been able to read it yet. Now, it lives at Yale University, and everyone is still curious about its secrets.",
