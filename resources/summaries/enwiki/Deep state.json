	"summary": "A deep state refers to a hidden government system where powerful groups or individuals operate secretly, making their own decisions without the knowledge of the public or elected leaders. They might have their own plans and might not always act in the best interest of the country. This concept is often seen as suspicious and is linked to conspiracy ideas. It suggests that there's a hidden layer of control within a government, separate from the official one.",
