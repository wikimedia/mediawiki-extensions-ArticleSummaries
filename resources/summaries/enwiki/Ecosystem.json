They're connected through cycles like nutrient and energy flow.\n\nEcosystems are influenced by outside factors like climate and soil, and also by internal factors like competition and decomposition. They're always changing after disturbances, striving to return to a stable state.\n\nEcosystems provide us with important things like food, water, and clean air. But human activities can harm them, leading to loss of species and resources.",
