	"summary": "Bourbon whiskey is an American drink made mostly from corn. It's named after the French House of Bourbon, but it might have come from places in Kentucky or New Orleans that were also named after them. Bourbon has been made since the 1700s and is usually linked to the Southern United States, especially Kentucky. It's a big business, with lots of money made from selling it in the U.S. and around the world. In 1964, the U.S. Congress said bourbon is a special American product. To be called bourbon, it must be made in the U.S. using at least 51% corn and aged in new, charred oak barrels.",
