	"summary": "Butterflies are colorful winged insects known for their beautiful, often bright, wings and unique flight pattern. They belong to the lepidopteran group and have been around for millions of years. Butterflies go through four life stages: egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa (chrysalis), and adult. They lay eggs on plants, which hatch into caterpillars that eventually form a chrysalis and emerge as adult butterflies. Some species migrate over long distances, while others live in specific habitats. Butterflies play important roles in ecosystems, helping with pollination and controlling other insect populations. They are also popular in art and culture due to their beauty.",
