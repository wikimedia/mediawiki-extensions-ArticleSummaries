	"summary": "Blood is a vital fluid in our body that travels through blood vessels, thanks to our heart's pumping. It carries important stuff like oxygen and nutrients to our cells and takes away waste. Blood is made up of blood cells (red, white, and platelets) floating in plasma, which is mostly water. Red blood cells are the most common and help carry oxygen. White blood cells fight infections, and platelets help blood clot. Blood is bright red when it has oxygen and darker when it doesn't.",
