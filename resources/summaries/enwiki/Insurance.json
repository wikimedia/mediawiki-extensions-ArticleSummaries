	"summary": "Insurance is like a safety net. You pay a small amount, called a premium, to an insurance company. In return, they promise to help you financially if something bad happens, like a fire or an accident. This protects you from big losses.\n\nThe company that provides insurance is called an insurer, and the person buying it is a policyholder. The policy is a contract that explains what's covered. If you need help, you make a claim, and the insurer pays for the damage after you pay a small fee, known as a deductible. Sometimes, insurers share risks with other companies to stay safe.",
