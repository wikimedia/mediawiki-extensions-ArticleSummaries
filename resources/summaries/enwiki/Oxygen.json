	"summary": "Oxygen (symbol: O) is a highly reactive non-metal element with atomic number 8. It's the most abundant element in Earth's crust and the third most common in the universe. Oxygen atoms often form dioxygen (O2), a colorless gas that makes up 20.95% of Earth's atmosphere.\n\nAll living organisms, except some bacteria, need oxygen for cellular respiration, which gives energy to cells. It's produced by plants and algae through photosynthesis. Oxygen has many industrial uses, like making steel and plastics, and in medical treatments like oxygen therapy.",
