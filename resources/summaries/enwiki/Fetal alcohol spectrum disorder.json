	"summary": "FASDs are problems that can happen when a baby is exposed to alcohol before birth. About 1 in 20 Americans have FASD, but it's often not diagnosed correctly. There are different types, from most severe (Fetal Alcohol Syndrome) to least severe. The risk of FASD gets higher with more alcohol consumed during pregnancy.\n\nDoctors check for FASD by looking at growth, facial features, and if the mother drank alcohol. There's no cure, but treatment can help. Experts say women should avoid alcohol during pregnancy and when trying to get pregnant. FASD is common worldwide, but many people don't realize they have it.",
