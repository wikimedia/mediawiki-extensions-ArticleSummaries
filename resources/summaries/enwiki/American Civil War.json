	"summary": "The American Civil War was a conflict between the northern states (Union) and the southern states (Confederacy) that seceded from the U.S. over slavery. Abraham Lincoln's election in 1860 sparked the war when southern states feared slavery would be banned. The Confederacy attacked Fort Sumter, starting the war. The Union won key battles, like Vicksburg and Gettysburg, and abolished slavery with the Emancipation Proclamation. The war ended with General Lee's surrender, leading to Reconstruction and the reunification of the nation. It was the bloodiest war in American history, with over 600,000 soldiers killed.",
