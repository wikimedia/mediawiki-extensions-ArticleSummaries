	"summary": "The Apple Network Server (ANS) was a short-lived line of servers from Apple, released in 1996 and discontinued in 1997 due to financial troubles. These servers used PowerPC processors and were designed to run the AIX operating system, not the classic Mac OS. There were three models, ranging from $11,000 to $19,000, offering different levels of performance. The ANS was not part of the Macintosh family and marked Apple's departure from the Mac OS for servers. This product was short-lived, as Apple focused on other priorities under CEO Gil Amelio.",
