	"summary": "## Martin Luther and the Ninety-five Theses\n\nIn 1517, Martin Luther, a German professor, wrote the Ninety-five Theses, a list of ideas for debate. He was upset about the Catholic Church selling \"indulgences,\" which people thought could reduce time in purgatory after death. Luther argued that true forgiveness comes from inner repentance, not buying certificates. He sent his ideas to a bishop and might have posted them on a church door. The Theses sparked a big debate, starting the Protestant Reformation and leading to the creation of new Christian denominations.",
