	"summary": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of inherited blood disorders. The main type is sickle cell anemia, which affects the protein in red blood cells, making them sickle-shaped. This can cause pain, anemia, and other health problems. SCD usually starts affecting people around 5-6 months old. It's caused by inheriting two abnormal copies of a gene from each parent.\n\nSymptoms can be managed with medicine, blood transfusions, and gene therapy. People with one abnormal copy have \"sickle cell trait\" and usually don't have symptoms. SCD is most common in Sub-Saharan Africa but also affects people in other parts of the world.",
