Scientologists believe in reincarnation and a process called auditing to remove mental blocks. The Church of Scientology, founded in 1954, is the main organization, but there are also independent practitioners.\n\nScientology has faced many controversies, including criminal activities and allegations of exploitation. It has been called a cult and a business, and its recognition as a religion varies by country. Despite criticisms, it has gained legal religious status in some places.",
