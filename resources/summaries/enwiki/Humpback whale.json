	"summary": "Humpback whales are massive marine mammals, growing up to 56 feet long and weighing 44 tons. They have long fins and bumps on their heads. These whales are famous for jumping out of the water and making unique sounds, which males use to communicate.\n\nFound globally, they travel thousands of miles each year, eating tiny shrimp-like creatures and small fish. Orcas are their main predators. Historically, hunting nearly wiped them out, but their population is recovering. Today, they face new threats like getting caught in fishing nets and ship collisions.",
