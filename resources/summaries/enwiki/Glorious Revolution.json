	"summary": "The Glorious Revolution happened in 1688 when King James II was removed from power in England, Scotland, and Ireland. His daughter Mary and her husband William of Orange took the throne instead. This happened because James' Catholic beliefs and policies made many people unhappy, especially when his son was born and could continue a Catholic dynasty. William invaded England with an army, and James had to leave the country. Parliament then made William and Mary kings. This event showed that Parliament was more powerful than the king. William also ruled as the leader of the Netherlands, making England and the Netherlands allies against France.",
