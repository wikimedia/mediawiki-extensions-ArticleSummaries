	"summary": "Bubonic plague is a disease caused by bacteria called Yersinia pestis. It gives you symptoms like fever, headaches, and swollen, painful lymph nodes. It's spread mainly by infected fleas from small animals. If you don't treat it, bubonic plague can kill 30% to 90% of people who get it. But if you take antibiotics, the risk of death goes down to around 10%. This disease has caused big outbreaks in history, like the Black Death in the 14th century.",
