	"summary": "The Igbo people are a large ethnic group in Nigeria, primarily living in five states. They are also found in parts of Cameroon, Gabon, and Equatorial Guinea. Their origins are unclear. The Igbo language is part of the Niger-Congo family. Before British rule, Igbo political structures were fragmented. Christianity became widespread among the Igbo during the colonial era. After Nigeria's independence, Igbo tensions led to the failed attempt to create the independent state of Biafra, resulting in a civil war. Today, some groups still advocate for Igbo self-determination.",
