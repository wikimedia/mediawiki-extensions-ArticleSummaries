	"summary": "Quasars are incredibly bright objects in space, powered by huge black holes. They're like galactic \"light bulbs,\" shining thousands of times brighter than entire galaxies like ours. These black holes pull in gas, which heats up and releases energy as light. Quasars are so far away, some of their light has taken over 700 million years to reach us! Scientists use special telescopes to study them and learn about the early universe.",
