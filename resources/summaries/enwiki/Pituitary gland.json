	"summary": "## Pituitary Gland: A Tiny Powerhouse\n\nThe pituitary gland, about the size of a kidney bean, sits at the base of the human brain. It has two main parts: the anterior lobe, which makes and releases hormones that control growth, metabolism, and more; and the posterior lobe, which releases hormones produced in the brain's hypothalamus. These hormones are vital for many body functions, like growth, blood pressure, and reproduction. Think of it as the body's command center, sending out important messages to keep everything running smoothly.",
