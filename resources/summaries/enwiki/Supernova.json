	"summary": "A supernova is a massive star explosion, brighter than an entire galaxy. They happen when a large star runs out of fuel or a white dwarf star explodes. These explosions can create neutron stars or black holes.\n\nSupernovae are important because they:\n- Scatter elements like oxygen and rubidium into space.\n- Create cosmic rays.\n- Trigger the birth of new stars.\n\nThe last supernova seen in our galaxy, the Milky Way, was in 1604. Scientists believe they happen about three times every century in the Milky Way.",
