	"summary": "Yin and yang are ancient Chinese concepts representing opposite yet connected forces in the universe. Yin is associated with darkness, passivity, and cold, while yang is linked to brightness, activity, and warmth. These forces create a cycle, like day and night, where one cannot exist without the other. They are found in nature, like seasons and gender, and in people's personalities. The symbol of yin and yang shows two intertwined shapes, each containing a dot of the other, symbolizing balance. This idea influences Chinese philosophy, medicine, and martial arts, emphasizing that everything has both yin and yang aspects.",
