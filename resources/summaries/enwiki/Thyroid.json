	"summary": "## Thyroid Gland: A Simple Explanation\n\nThe thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland in your neck. It makes hormones that control your body's energy levels, growth, and how well you think.\n\nThese hormones are called T3, T4, and calcitonin. They're controlled by other glands in your brain.\n\nSometimes the thyroid gland can have problems, like making too much (hyperthyroidism) or too little (hypothyroidism) hormone. These issues can be caused by things like a lack of iodine or autoimmune diseases.",
