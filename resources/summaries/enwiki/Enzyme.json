	"summary": "Enzymes are special proteins that help speed up chemical reactions in living things. They work by changing other molecules, called substrates, into new ones called products. This process is important for our bodies to work properly.\n\nOne example is the enzyme glucosidase, which breaks down maltose sugar into two glucose sugars. Enzymes are very specific and only work on certain substrates. They also need the right conditions, like temperature and pH, to work well. Some enzymes are used in products like laundry detergent to help clean clothes.",
