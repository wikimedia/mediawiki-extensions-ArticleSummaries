	"summary": "In 2022, a former student in Brazil shot and killed three teachers and a 6th-grader at their school. This is called a school shooting, which is when someone uses a gun at an educational place. School shootings happen most often in the United States, but they can happen anywhere. They have caused debates about gun laws and school safety. Research shows that these events can be due to easy access to guns, family problems, lack of supervision, and mental health issues. Common reasons behind these attacks include bullying, revenge, and seeking attention.",
