Discovered in 1791, it was named after the Titans of Greek mythology. Titanium is used in many ways: in airplanes and spaceships because it's strong and light, in medicine because it's safe for the body, and in things like jewelry and electronics. It's also very resistant to rusting, even in seawater.",
