	"summary": "Bismuth (symbol Bi) is a metal with the atomic number 83. It looks like silver but turns slightly pink when it reacts with air. Bismuth is not very conductive and is one of the most diamagnetic elements. It was once thought to be stable, but it's actually slightly radioactive, with a very long half-life.\n\nBismuth has been known for centuries, but was often confused with lead and tin. It's used in cosmetics, pigments, and medicine, like diarrhea medicine. Bismuth expands when it cools, which is useful for casting metal objects. It's also less toxic than lead, so it's used as a replacement in many applications.",
