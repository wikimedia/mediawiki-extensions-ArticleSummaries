They have their own languages, called Sámi languages, and traditionally speak Sámi. Historically known as Lapps, they prefer to be called Sámi.\n\nTheir culture includes various jobs like fishing, trapping animals for fur, and herding sheep. Reindeer herding is their most famous tradition, with some Sámi still relying on it for meat, fur, and transport. This practice is legally protected for Sámi in certain Nordic areas.",
