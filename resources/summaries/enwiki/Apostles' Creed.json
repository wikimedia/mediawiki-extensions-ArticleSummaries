	"summary": "The Apostles' Creed is a Christian statement of faith, believed to have started in 5th-century France. It's a simpler version of the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed, focusing on God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\n\nThe creed is named after the twelve apostles, who, according to a medieval belief, each contributed a part. It has been used in Western Christianity for centuries, including in Catholic, Lutheran, and Anglican churches. Despite its name, it doesn't explicitly state Jesus' divinity, making it older than the Nicene Creed in medieval times.",
