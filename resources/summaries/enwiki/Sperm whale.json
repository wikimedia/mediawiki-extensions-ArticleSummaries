	"summary": "The sperm whale is the biggest toothed whale and predator. It's the only living member of its genus and has a global range. Females and young males live in groups, while adult males are solitary. Sperm whales dive very deeply, use echolocation, and have the loudest vocalizations of any animal. They live for over 70 years and have the largest brain on Earth. Their heads contain a waxy substance called spermaceti, which was historically valuable for oil lamps and other uses, leading to heavy hunting. Today, they are protected but still considered vulnerable.",
