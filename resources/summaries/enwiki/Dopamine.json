	"summary": "Dopamine is a special chemical in our bodies, like a messenger between brain cells. It's mostly known for making us feel good when we do something fun, but it's also about motivation and wanting rewards. It helps us move, focus, and even controls some hormones.\n\nIn the brain, dopamine is like a traffic light, directing how cells communicate. When we expect something good, dopamine levels rise. Drugs that affect dopamine can change how we feel and act, which is why some are used to treat health issues like Parkinson's disease or ADHD.",
