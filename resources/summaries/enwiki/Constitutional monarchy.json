	"summary": "A constitutional monarchy is a type of government where a king or queen's power is limited by a set of rules called a constitution. Unlike an absolute monarchy, the monarch must follow these rules and cannot make all the decisions alone. In some countries, the monarch has little power and mostly just represents the nation. In others, they have more authority but must still work within the constitution. Many democratic countries, like the United Kingdom and Sweden, have constitutional monarchies.",
