	"summary": "In Japanese pop culture, \"lolicon\" (short for \"Lolita complex\") is a type of media, like manga and anime, that shows young girl characters in a sexual way. It's important to know that this is just fictional characters and not real kids. People who like lolicon often enjoy the \"cute\" style and don't want to hurt anyone. Some countries have rules against this kind of art, but Japan doesn't. Many people argue about whether it's okay or not.",
