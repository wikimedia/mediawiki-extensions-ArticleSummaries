	"summary": "The 2016 US presidential election was a surprise win for Donald Trump and Mike Pence, who defeated Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine. It was a divisive campaign, with Trump's controversial views and Clinton's email scandal dominating the news. Despite polls predicting a Clinton win, Trump won key swing states and received more electoral votes. This election had the highest vote share for a third-party candidate since 1996 and was marked by Russian interference, though no collusion with the Trump campaign was found.",
