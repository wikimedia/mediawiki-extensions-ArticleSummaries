	"summary": "## Avant-Garde Art: Pushing Boundaries\n\nAvant-garde art is like the trailblazers of the art world. It's all about artists trying new and unusual things that might make people scratch their heads at first. These artists challenge traditional rules and ideas about art, literature, and even politics. They use their creativity to push for change in society.\n\nThink of it like a military vanguard, leading the way and testing new ground. Avant-garde artists often work ahead of their time, creating styles and ideas that later become accepted. This can be seen in movements like Dada, Surrealism, and postmodernism.",
