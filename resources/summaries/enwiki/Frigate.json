	"summary": "A frigate is a type of warship that has changed over time. In the 17th and 18th centuries, frigates were fast ships for scouting and patrol. France then designed the 'true frigate' with one armed deck. Later, armored frigates were powerful ironclad warships. In World War II, frigates became medium-sized escort ships. After the war, the term was used for various ships, from large anti-submarine vessels to smaller ones resembling corvettes or destroyers. Today, some navies use \"frigate\" for both destroyers and true frigates.",
