	"summary": "Artsakh, also known as Nagorno-Karabakh, was a region claimed by both Azerbaijan and Armenia. It became a breakaway state controlled by ethnic Armenians after a war in the 1990s. The area was originally an enclave within Azerbaijan, but it had a strong connection to Armenia. After a 2020 war, Azerbaijan regained control of most of the territory, leaving Artsakh with a small land corridor to Armenia. In 2023, another conflict led to the collapse of Artsakh's government and the flight of its Armenian population to Armenia.",
