	"summary": "Haitian Vodou is a religion that combined African and Roman Catholic beliefs during the slave trade in the 1600s-1800s. It has no central leader and is practiced by many Haitians alongside Catholicism. \n\nVodou believes in a creator, Bondye, and spirits called lwa, linked to African deities and Catholic saints. These lwa can possess people during rituals with drumming, singing, and dancing. Offerings like fruit and animals are made to them. \n\nBorn from African slaves' traditions, it played a role in Haiti's independence and is now practiced worldwide, mainly by Haitians but also by people of other ethnicities.",
