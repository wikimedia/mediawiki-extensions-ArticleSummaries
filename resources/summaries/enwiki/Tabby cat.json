	"summary": "Tabby cats have a special coat pattern with stripes and an \"M\" shape on their foreheads. This pattern comes from wild cats like the European wildcat. There are four main tabby patterns: mackerel (striped), classic (blotched), ticked (speckled), and spotted. Tabby isn't a specific breed; it's a type of coat found in many breeds and mixed-breed cats. These patterns are natural and similar to those of wild cats related to domestic cats.",
