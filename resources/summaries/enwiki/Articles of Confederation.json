	"summary": "The Articles of Confederation was the first government document of the United States, created in 1777. It was an agreement between the 13 states to form a \"Perpetual Union.\" The goal was to keep the states independent while having a weak central government. This government could only do what the colonies had let the king and parliament do.\n\nOver time, leaders realized this government was too weak. After Shays's Rebellion, they decided to make changes. In 1787, they met and created a new plan, the U.S. Constitution, which replaced the Articles in 1789. The Constitution created a stronger government with a president, courts, and the power to tax.",
