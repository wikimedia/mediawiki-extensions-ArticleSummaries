	"summary": "The A-10 Thunderbolt II is a powerful attack aircraft used by the U.S. Air Force since 1977. It's known for its tough design, with lots of armor to protect it. The plane is great for supporting ground troops, as it can take off and land on short runways near the action. Its main weapon is a strong 30mm cannon. The A-10 has been in many battles, like the Gulf War and fights against the Islamic State. Though it's getting older, the Air Force is still upgrading it to keep it flying. Some people want to replace it with the F-35, but others think it's still very useful.",
