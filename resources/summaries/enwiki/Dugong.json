	"summary": "The dugong is a unique marine mammal found in the Indo-West Pacific. It's related to manatees but has a dolphin-like tail and a special downturned snout for eating seagrass. Dugongs live in coastal areas and depend on seagrass for food. They've been hunted for their meat and oil for centuries, and now many populations are at risk of extinction. Threats include fishing accidents, habitat loss, and traditional hunting. Protecting dugongs is important, but their slow reproduction makes it hard for their numbers to recover.",
