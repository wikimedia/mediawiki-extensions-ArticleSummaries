	"summary": "The Ozarks is a large area of mountains and plateaus in Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and a small part of Kansas. It's made up of two main mountain ranges: the Boston Mountains and the St. Francois Mountains. The highest point is Wahzhazhe Summit in Arkansas, standing at 2,561 feet. This region is unique because it's the biggest highland area between the Appalachian and Rocky Mountains. People often call it the \"U.S. Interior Highlands.\" Cities like Springfield and Branson in Missouri are popular places to experience the Ozarks' culture and natural beauty.",
