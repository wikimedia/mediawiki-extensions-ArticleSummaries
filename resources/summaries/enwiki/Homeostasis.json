	"summary": "Homeostasis is like a superpower that helps our bodies stay healthy and work properly. It's the process of keeping everything in our bodies balanced, like temperature, fluid levels, and the amount of stuff like sodium and sugar in our blood. These things need to stay within a certain range, even when we're facing changes in our environment or what we eat.\n\nOur bodies have special sensors (receptors) that detect changes and send signals to control centers, which then tell effectors (like muscles or glands) to make adjustments. This keeps our bodies in a state of equilibrium, which is super important for us to function at our best.",
