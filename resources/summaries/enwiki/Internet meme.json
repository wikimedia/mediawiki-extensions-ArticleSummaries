	"summary": "An internet meme is a funny or interesting idea, image, or video that spreads quickly online, especially on social media. They can be pictures, videos, or even just phrases. Memes often copy and change other memes, and they can become very popular very fast. The word \"meme\" was first used by Richard Dawkins in 1972 to describe how ideas spread. As the internet grew, so did memes, with new types like \"dank\" memes and short videos. Now, memes are a big part of online culture and are even studied by researchers.",
