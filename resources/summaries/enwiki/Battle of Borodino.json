	"summary": "The Battle of Borodino (1812) was a major fight between Napoleon's army (Grande Arm√©e) and Russia's Imperial Army. It happened near Borodino village during Napoleon's invasion of Russia. Though Napoleon's side won, they didn't achieve a clear victory and lost many soldiers. This was a big mistake, as it let the Russian army retreat and continue fighting.\n\nThe battle involved around 250,000 troops and was the bloodiest day of the Napoleonic Wars. Napoleon later described it as a close call, praising both his own army and the unconquerable Russians.",
