	"summary": "**Ontology: Understanding What Exists**\n\nOntology is the study of what exists in the universe. It looks at the basic structure of reality, grouping things into categories. For example, unique things like people are \"particulars,\" while general things like colors are \"universals.\" Ontologists debate what's truly realâ€”like if numbers or moral facts exist. Some believe only matter is real (materialism), while others say mind and matter are separate (dualism).\n\nOntology uses various methods, like analyzing concepts and experiments, to understand reality. It's important for fields like computer science, helping to organize information. Ontology has ancient roots but became a formal discipline in modern philosophy.",
