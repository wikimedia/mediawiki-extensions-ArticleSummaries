	"summary": "Brutalism is an architecture style that started in the 1950s in the UK. It's known for its simple, no-frills design, often using bare concrete, brick, and geometric shapes. The style is all about showing off the building's true materials and structure, with no extra decorations. The term \"brutalism\" comes from the French word for raw concrete. This style was used for many public buildings like libraries and city halls. Some people love it, calling it iconic, while others think it's too cold and stark.",
