	"summary": "\"Carmen\" is an opera by French composer Georges Bizet, based on a story by Prosper Mérimée. It tells the tale of Don José, a soldier who is enchanted by the gypsy Carmen, leading to his downfall. The opera, first performed in 1875, was controversial for its time due to its realistic portrayal of working-class life and lawlessness. Despite initial criticism, \"Carmen\" became one of the most popular operas worldwide, known for its catchy arias like the \"Habanera\" and \"Toreador Song.\" Bizet died soon after its release, but his music's brilliance and emotional depth are now widely celebrated.",
