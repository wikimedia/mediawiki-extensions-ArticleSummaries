	"summary": "Astrology is a practice that claims to predict events and understand people by studying the stars and planets. It's been around for thousands of years and was important in many ancient cultures. People used it to make calendars and understand the world. Western astrology, which we still use today, started in ancient Mesopotamia.\n\nWhile some people believe in astrology, many scientists and thinkers have criticized it. During the Enlightenment, astrology became less respected. Scientific studies have shown that astrology doesn't have any real power to predict the future. Despite this, astrology remains popular, especially since the 1960s.",
