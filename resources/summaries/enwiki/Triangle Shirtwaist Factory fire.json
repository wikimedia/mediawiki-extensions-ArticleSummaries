	"summary": "The Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in New York City in 1911 was a tragic event that led to major changes in workplace safety. A fire broke out in the garment factory, located on the top floors of a building, and 146 workers, mostly young immigrant women, lost their lives. The doors were locked, preventing many from escaping. This disaster highlighted the need for better safety measures, like unlocked exits and fire sprinklers. It also inspired laws to improve working conditions and helped strengthen a union for garment workers.",
