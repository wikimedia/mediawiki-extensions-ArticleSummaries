	"summary": "Lidar, short for \"light detection and ranging,\" is a tool that uses laser beams to measure distances and create 3D models of objects and surfaces. It works by sending a laser pulse and measuring the time it takes to bounce back.\n\nThis technology is versatile, with applications on land, in the air, and even for mapping the ocean floor. It's used for making detailed maps, surveying, archaeology, and even helping self-driving cars navigate. Advanced versions, like Quantum Lidar, offer improved efficiency and sensitivity.",
