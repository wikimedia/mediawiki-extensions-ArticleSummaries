	"summary": "Biodiversity is the variety of life on Earth, from genes to entire ecosystems. It's highest in the tropics due to warm climates and productive ecosystems. Over Earth's history, there have been six major mass extinctions causing big drops in biodiversity. Human activities like farming and climate change are causing another extinction event, called the Holocene extinction. This could lead to the loss of up to 30% of all species by 2050.",
