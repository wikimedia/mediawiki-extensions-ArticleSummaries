It's in almost everything we use, from homes to coffee shops. \n\nOver 800 companies work together to make sure different Wi-Fi devices can talk to each other.  Wi-Fi uses different radio frequencies to send data, and can reach speeds up to 9.6 gigabits per second. Walls and other obstacles can block the signal, but this also helps prevent interference between networks.",
