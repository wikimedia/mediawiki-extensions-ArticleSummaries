	"summary": "Ethnicity refers to a group of people who share certain characteristics, like language, culture, or history, and see themselves as different from others. These groups can be big or small, and people might belong to one or more. Ethnicity can change over time due to things like marriage, learning new cultures, or moving to new places. Sometimes, smaller groups within a larger one can become their own ethnicity, or different ethnicities might merge into one. The idea of ethnicity has been studied in different ways, with some seeing it as something natural and ancient, while others believe it's more about social rules and can change over time.",
