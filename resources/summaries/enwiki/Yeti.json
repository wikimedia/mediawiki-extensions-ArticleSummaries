	"summary": "The Yeti, also known as the Abominable Snowman, is a mythical ape-like creature said to live in the Himalayas. People have claimed to see it and have found large footprints, but many of these are proven or thought to be hoaxes. The Yeti's legend might come from local folklore and misidentified animals like bears or yaks. It's often compared to North America's Bigfoot due to their similar descriptions.",
