	"summary": "**Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori): A Simple Summary**\n\nH. pylori is a curved, spiral-shaped bacterium that lives in the stomach. Discovered in 1983, it can cause stomach ulcers and cancer, but most people with it don't get sick. Over half the world's population has it, more common in poorer countries. It can lead to problems like anemia and diabetes, but some studies say it might also protect against certain diseases. Doctors use antibiotics to treat it. The risk of stomach cancer is high if it causes long-term stomach inflammation.",
