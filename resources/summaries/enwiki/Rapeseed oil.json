It's one of the oldest vegetable oils but was once only used industrially due to its high erucic acid content, which is harmful in large amounts. \n\nCanola oil is a special type with low erucic acid, making it safe to eat. It's made from specific rapeseed varieties and is regulated to contain less than 2% erucic acid. \n\nRapeseed is grown worldwide, with Canada and Europe being major producers. The oil has various uses, from cooking to industry.",
