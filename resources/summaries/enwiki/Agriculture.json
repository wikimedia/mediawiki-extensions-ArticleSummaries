	"summary": "Agriculture is all about growing crops, raising animals, and managing natural resources like forests and water. It began around 11,500 years ago when people started planting grains and domesticating animals. This led to the growth of cities and civilizations.\n\nToday, agriculture is a huge industry, with large farms producing most of the world's food. These farms use modern techniques and technology to increase crop yields but can also cause environmental problems like pollution and climate change. Small farms are still important, especially in rural areas, supporting local economies and communities.\n\nAgriculture provides us with food, clothing, and many other products, but it must be managed carefully to protect the environment and ensure future food security.",
