	"summary": "Proteins are large biomolecules made of amino acids linked together like a chain. They do many jobs in our bodies, like speeding up chemical reactions (enzymes), giving cells their shape, and fighting infections.\n\nThe order of amino acids in a protein determines its unique 3D shape, which decides its job. Sometimes, proteins have extra helper molecules attached, called prosthetic groups.\n\nProteins don't last forever; they get broken down and recycled by our cells.",
