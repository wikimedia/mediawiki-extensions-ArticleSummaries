	"summary": "**Breeder Reactors: A Summary**\n\nBreeder reactors are special nuclear reactors that make more fuel than they use. Instead of relying on rare uranium-235, they can use more common isotopes like uranium-238 and thorium-232. These are called \"fertile\" materials.\n\nThe reactor's high neutron economy allows extra neutrons to be absorbed by the fertile material, turning it into usable fuel. This process is called \"breeding.\"\n\nBreeder reactors were once promising due to efficient fuel use, but interest decreased after the 1960s when more uranium was discovered and enrichment methods became cheaper.",
