	"summary": "Anglerfish are a group of bony fish known for their unique hunting method. They have a glowing lure, called the esca, which they use to attract other fish as prey. This glow comes from special bacteria living on or inside them. Some anglerfish, especially the deep-sea kinds, have a big difference in size between males and females. Males can be much smaller than females. These fish are found all over the world, in both deep and shallow waters, and near or far from the sea floor.",
