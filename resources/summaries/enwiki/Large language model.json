	"summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are computer programs that can understand and generate human-like text. They learn from massive amounts of text data, similar to how we learn from books and conversations. The most advanced LLMs use a special design called a transformer, which helps them process and create long texts quickly. These models can perform various tasks, like answering questions or writing stories, and they can be customized for specific jobs. However, they might also reflect the mistakes and biases found in their training data.",
