	"summary": "Confirmation bias is when people only look for and remember information that supports their existing beliefs, while ignoring the rest. This happens more strongly with things they really want to be true, or when they're feeling very emotional about an issue. It can lead to making bad decisions, because people are only considering one side of the evidence. For example, a scientist might only notice results that fit their theory, or a person might only read news stories that match their opinions. This can make people overconfident in their beliefs, even if there's evidence against them.",
