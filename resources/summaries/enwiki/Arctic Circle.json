	"summary": "The Arctic Circle is an imaginary line on Earth's map, located around 67Â° north of the Equator. It marks the boundary of the Arctic region. This circle is special because on the winter solstice, the sun doesn't rise, and on the summer solstice, the sun doesn't set. This phenomenon is known as polar night and midnight sun. The Arctic Circle's position isn't fixed and is slowly moving northwards due to the Earth's tilt and the Moon's orbit.",
