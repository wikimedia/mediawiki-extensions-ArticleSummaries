	"summary": "Feng shui is an ancient Chinese practice that aims to harmonize people with their environment using energy forces. It literally means \"wind-water\" and involves arranging spaces to let \"Qi,\" or cosmic energy, flow smoothly. People use feng shui to decide where to build homes, buildings, and even tombs. While it's seen as a way to improve health and wealth in the West, many scientists consider it pseudoscience because its claims can't be proven using scientific methods.",
