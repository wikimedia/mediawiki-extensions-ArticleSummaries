	"summary": "Unitarianism is a type of Christianity that believes in one God, unlike traditional Christianity, which teaches the Trinity (God as three persons in one). Unitarians think Jesus was a great teacher inspired by God but not equal to God. They don't follow the usual Christian creeds.\n\nThis faith started in the 16th century in Poland and Transylvania. People who believed in Unitarianism were often persecuted, so they spread across Europe and to other countries, including the United States. The first Unitarian church in North America was in Boston in 1784.",
