	"summary": "The Battle of the Alamo (1836) was a key moment in the Texas Revolution. Mexican troops led by General Antonio LÃ³pez de Santa Anna besieged and recaptured the Alamo Mission in San Antonio. About 100 Texians, including James Bowie and William B. Travis, defended the mission but were eventually overcome. The Mexican Army killed most of the Texians. News of the defeat spread panic and motivated more people to join the Texian Army, leading to their victory at the Battle of San Jacinto later that year. Today, the Alamo is a famous historic site and symbol of Texas independence.",
