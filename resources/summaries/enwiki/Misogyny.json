	"summary": "Misogyny is the dislike or prejudice against women, which has a long history, dating back thousands of years. The term was first used in the 1600s, derived from Greek words meaning \"hatred of women.\" It describes attitudes and behaviors that keep women in a lower social position. This can include violence, harassment, and exclusion from opportunities. Misogyny can be obvious or hidden, and it often goes hand-in-hand with other forms of prejudice. Feminist movements have brought more attention to this issue.",
