	"summary": "American Airlines Flight 587 was a plane that crashed in New York City in 2001, soon after taking off from John F. Kennedy Airport. All 260 people on board died, along with 5 people on the ground. It's the second-worst plane crash in U.S. history. The National Transportation Safety Board found that the crash was caused by the first officer using the rudder controls too much to avoid turbulence from another plane. This caused the plane's tail to break off, and the engines also fell off before the plane hit the ground in a neighborhood in Queens.",
