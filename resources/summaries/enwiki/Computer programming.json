	"summary": "Computer programming, or coding, is like giving a computer a set of instructions to do a task. Programmers use special languages to write these instructions, called code. This code is then translated into machine code that the computer's brain, the CPU, can understand. It's a complex process that requires knowledge of different programming languages, algorithms, and logic. Programmers also test, fix, and manage the code to ensure it works correctly. The entire process of creating software is often called software development or software engineering.",
