Each color is made up of different amounts of red, green, and blue light, with each component having 256 possible values (0-255). This allows for over 16 million possible colors. Some colors can even go beyond this range. Web colors have a specific definition called sRGB, which helps ensure they look consistent across different devices and platforms.",
