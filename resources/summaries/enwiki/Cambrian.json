During this time, many new animal species appeared, including ancestors of most modern phyla. The climate was warm, with high carbon dioxide levels.\n\nContinents were mostly in the southern hemisphere, surrounded by a vast ocean. This period saw the beginning of the assembly of the supercontinent Gondwana. The Cambrian ended with creatures like myriapods and arachnids starting to live on land, along with early plants.",
