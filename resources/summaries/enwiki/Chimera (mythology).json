	"summary": "In Greek mythology, the Chimera was a scary monster with parts from different animals. It looked like a lion with a goat's head on its back and a snake's head at the end of its tail. Sometimes, it had wings. This creature was said to breathe fire. The word \"chimera\" now means any made-up creature with mixed animal parts. It can also describe something that seems very unlikely or just a dream.",
