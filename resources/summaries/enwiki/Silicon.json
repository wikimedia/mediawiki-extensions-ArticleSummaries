	"summary": "**Silicon: A Key Element**\n\nSilicon (Si) is a hard, grayish-blue solid found in group 14 of the periodic table. It's a semiconductor, meaning it conducts electricity under certain conditions. Silicon is essential for plants and some sea creatures.\n\nIt's mostly used in its natural form, like in construction materials (cement, concrete) and glass.  But a small amount of pure silicon is crucial for making transistors and computer chips, driving the modern tech economy.",
