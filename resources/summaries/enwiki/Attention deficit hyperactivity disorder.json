	"summary": "ADHD is a brain-based condition that makes it hard for people to focus, control impulses, and stay calm. It can cause problems like trouble at school, difficulty making friends, and health risks. People with ADHD might have a hard time finishing tasks that aren't fun or rewarding. But they can focus intensely on things they enjoy, a trait called hyperfocus.\n\nThe exact causes are often unknown, but it's usually due to a mix of genetic and early-life environmental factors. It's not caused by parenting or social factors. While most cases start in childhood, rare cases can be caused by brain injuries or other events.",
