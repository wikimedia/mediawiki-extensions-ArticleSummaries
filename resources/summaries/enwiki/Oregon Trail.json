	"summary": "The Oregon Trail was a 2,170-mile path in the U.S. that let people travel from Missouri to Oregon. It was first used by fur traders around 1811. By 1836, people could use wagons on parts of the trail. Many settlers used the trail between 1846 and 1869 to reach Oregon. After 1869, when the first transcontinental railroad was built, fewer people used the trail. Today, highways like I-80 and I-84 follow parts of the original trail.",
