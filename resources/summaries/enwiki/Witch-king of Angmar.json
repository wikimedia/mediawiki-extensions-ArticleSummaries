Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings.\" He was once a human king who received a Ring of Power from the dark lord Sauron, turning him into a fearsome, invisible wraith. He leads the Nine Ringwraiths and aims to reclaim the One Ring. In the story, he attacks Frodo Baggins and later battles Éowyn. He is eventually defeated by Éowyn and Merry Brandybuck. Tolkien originally planned different backgrounds for the character, but settled on a mortal man corrupted by Sauron's ring.",
