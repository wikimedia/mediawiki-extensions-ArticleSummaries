	"summary": "Abstraction is like a superpower that helps us understand things by finding patterns and general rules. It's a way to simplify complex ideas by focusing on the most important parts. For example, when you think of a \"ball,\" you don't just think of a soccer ball; you imagine all types of balls, like basketballs or ping-pong balls. This is abstraction at work! It allows us to group similar things together and understand their common features.",
