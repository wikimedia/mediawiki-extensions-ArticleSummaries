	"summary": "Vitiligo is a skin condition where some areas lose their color, creating white patches. It happens when the body's immune system attacks the cells that make skin color. We don't know the exact cause, but it might be linked to genes, stress, or sun exposure. This condition can affect anyone, regardless of their skin color, and the white spots can appear anywhere on the body. Treatment includes special creams, light therapy, or surgery to improve the skin's appearance. The spots might change over time, but they usually stay in the same general area.",
