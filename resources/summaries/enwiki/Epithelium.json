	"summary": "Epithelium is a protective tissue made of cells that form a thin layer. It's like the skin's outer layer, called the epidermis. This tissue lines many organs, body cavities, and blood vessels inside our bodies. There are different types of epithelial cells shaped like squares, columns, or cubes. They can form single or multiple layers. Epithelial tissue doesn't have blood vessels, so it gets nutrients from the connective tissue below. These cells are important for various body functions like diffusion and secretion.",
