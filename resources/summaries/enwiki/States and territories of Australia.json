	"summary": "Australia is made up of six states and ten federal territories. States are like mini-countries with their own governments, laws, and courts, but they're still part of Australia. Territories are areas controlled by the federal government, and some have their own local governments.\n\nThe states are: New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria, and Western Australia. The Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory are the most important territories, as they have their own governments and can make laws, just like the states.\n\nThe federal government can override laws made by states and territories, and the High Court of Australia is the highest court for everyone.",
