	"summary": "A hors d'oeuvre is a small dish served before a meal, often called an appetizer or starter. They can be cold or hot and are usually eaten by hand. These dishes might include salads, cold meats, fish, fruit juices, or shellfish cocktails. Hors d'oeuvres are typically served before the main meal at parties or gatherings, but they can also be brought to the table as part of the dining experience. They are smaller in size compared to main courses and add variety to a meal.",
