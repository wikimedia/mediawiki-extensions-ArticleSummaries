	"summary": "Icarus, son of the craftsman Daedalus, escaped imprisonment with wings made of feathers, wax, and threads. Daedalus warned Icarus not to fly too high or low. However, Icarus flew too close to the sun, melting the wax. His wings failed, and he fell into the sea, drowning. This story teaches a lesson about following instructions and not being too ambitious. The phrase \"fly too close to the sun\" now means taking a risky action with negative consequences.",
