	"summary": "Test cricket is a special type of cricket game that is very traditional and important. It's like a big challenge for cricket players, testing their skills and how well they can last for up to five days! Two teams, wearing white, play against each other, each trying to score more runs than the other. The game is long, with 90 overs bowled each day. It started officially in the 1890s, but some old games from 1877 are also counted as Test matches now. The ICC World Test Championship is the biggest competition for this format.",
