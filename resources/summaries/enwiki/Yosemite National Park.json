	"summary": "Yosemite National Park, located in California, is a stunning place with huge granite cliffs, beautiful waterfalls, and giant sequoia trees. It's one of the biggest untouched areas in the Sierra Nevada mountains. The park's unique features were shaped by ancient glaciers. People have lived there for thousands of years, but it became a national park in 1890, thanks to people like John Muir who wanted to protect it. Today, millions of visitors enjoy Yosemite every year, mostly exploring the seven-square-mile valley.",
