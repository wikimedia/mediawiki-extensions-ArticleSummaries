	"summary": "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), also called Lou Gehrig's disease, is a rare, fatal nerve disease. It slowly takes away the ability to move, speak, and even breathe. Most people with ALS don't know why they have it, but some have a genetic link. There's no cure, but medicines and treatment can help people live longer and feel better. The disease usually starts around age 60 and most people live about 2 to 4 years after diagnosis. Doctors have known about ALS since at least the 1800s.",
