	"summary": "## The Photoelectric Effect\n\nThe photoelectric effect happens when light, like ultraviolet light, makes electrons fly off a metal. This was strange because scientists thought the electrons would need time to absorb energy from the light, but they found that only light with a certain frequency (not intensity) could make electrons move.\n\nAlbert Einstein explained this by showing that light is made of tiny energy packets called photons. This discovery was important for understanding that light acts like both a wave and a particle.",
