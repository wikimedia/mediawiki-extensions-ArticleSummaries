	"summary": "The Knights Hospitaller were a Catholic military order founded in the 1100s during the Crusades. They started as a group helping sick and poor pilgrims in Jerusalem. After the city was conquered, they became a military force, fighting to protect the Holy Land. Over time, they moved their base to places like Cyprus, Rhodes, and Malta. The order faced challenges like the Protestant Reformation and Napoleon's invasion of Malta. Today, similar groups carry on their work, helping people and keeping their traditions alive.",
