	"summary": "American football, or just football in the U.S. and Canada, is a team sport where two teams of 11 players try to score points by moving a ball down a field. The offense tries to advance the ball by running or throwing, while the defense tries to stop them. Teams get four tries (downs) to move 10 yards. If they succeed, they get more downs. Points are scored by getting the ball into the end zone (touchdown) or kicking it through the goalposts (field goal).\n\nFootball started in the U.S. in 1869, combining soccer and rugby rules. It's very popular in America, with professional and college games being the most-watched. The NFL, the professional league, is the richest sports league globally.",
