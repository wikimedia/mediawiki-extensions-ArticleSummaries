	"summary": "A triathlon is a challenging race that combines three sports: swimming, cycling, and running. Athletes compete to finish the fastest, moving from one sport to the next without stopping. The name comes from the Greek words for \"three\" and \"competition.\" It started in Southern California in the 1970s and has since grown with different variations. Triathletes train hard to build endurance, strength, and speed in all three sports.",
