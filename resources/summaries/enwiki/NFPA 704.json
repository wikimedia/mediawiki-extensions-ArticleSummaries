	"summary": "## NFPA 704: Fire Diamond Safety\n\nNFPA 704 is a safety system that uses a \"Fire Diamond\" or \"Safety Square\" to show the dangers of hazardous materials. You might see these squares on containers of chemicals like ethyl alcohol and acetone.\n\nEach side of the diamond tells you about a different kind of hazard: fire, explosion, health risk, and special dangers. This helps emergency workers know what to do when there's an accident, like using special equipment or following certain procedures. It's an important safety rule used all over the world when transporting chemicals.",
