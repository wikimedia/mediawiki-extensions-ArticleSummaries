	"summary": "Plague is a serious disease caused by a bacterium called Yersinia pestis. It can make you sick in different ways: fever, weakness, and headaches, or it can affect your lungs, blood, or lymph nodes, causing swelling and pain. You can get it from flea bites, infected animals, or from other people through the air. \n\nDoctors can test for it and treat it with antibiotics. It's rare, with about 600 cases worldwide each year, but it's important to see a doctor right away if you think you have it. Historically, plague has caused huge outbreaks, like the Black Death in the 14th century.",
