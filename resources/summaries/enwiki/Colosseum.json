Built by the Flavian emperors (Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian) in the 1st century AD, it could seat up to 80,000 people. It hosted exciting events like gladiator fights and animal hunts.\n\nMade of limestone, volcanic rock, and concrete, this iconic structure is a symbol of Imperial Rome. Despite some damage over time, it remains a popular tourist site and is even featured on Italy's 5 euro cent coin. Each Good Friday, the Pope leads a special procession starting near the Colosseum.",
