	"summary": "Protestantism is a major branch of Christianity that started in the 16th century. It began when Martin Luther, a German monk, wrote a list of complaints about the Catholic Church, called the Ninety-five Theses. He posted them on a church door in Wittenberg, Germany, in 1517.\n\nProtestants believe that people are saved by faith alone, and that the Bible is the only rule for faith and living. This led to the creation of many new churches, called denominations, with different beliefs. Today, Protestantism is one of the largest Christian groups worldwide, with over 600 million members.",
