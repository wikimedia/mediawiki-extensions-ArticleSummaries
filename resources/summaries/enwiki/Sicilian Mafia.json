	"summary": "The Sicilian Mafia, also known as Cosa Nostra, is a criminal group from Sicily, Italy. It started in the 1800s and is like a big gang with many smaller groups, or \"families.\" They offer protection and help solve problems for other criminals. Each family controls a specific area, like a town or part of a city. They call themselves \"men of honor.\" Over time, similar groups formed in other countries where Sicilian people moved, like Australia, the USA, and South America. These groups copied the Mafia's ways but changed some of their traditions.",
