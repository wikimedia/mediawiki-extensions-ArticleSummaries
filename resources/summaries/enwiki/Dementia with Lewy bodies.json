	"summary": "DLB is a type of dementia with unique symptoms. It affects sleep, behavior, movement, and body functions. Unlike other dementias, memory loss might not be the first sign. DLB was first identified in 1976 and is named after the protein clumps, called Lewy bodies, found in the brains of those with the condition.\n\nKey symptoms include dream-acting during sleep, hallucinations, and movement issues like stiffness and slow movement. DLB usually starts after age 50 and can be hard to diagnose. There's no cure, but medicines can help with some symptoms. People with DLB may live about four years after diagnosis, but managing symptoms is challenging.",
