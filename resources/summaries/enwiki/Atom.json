	"summary": "Atoms are tiny particles that make up elements. They have a nucleus with protons and neutrons, surrounded by electrons. The number of protons determines the element; for example, 11 protons make sodium, and 29 make copper. Atoms are very small, about 100 picometers, and can't be seen with regular microscopes. Most of an atom's mass is in its nucleus. Atoms can join together to form compounds, which is studied in chemistry. They can also split, a process called nuclear decay.",
