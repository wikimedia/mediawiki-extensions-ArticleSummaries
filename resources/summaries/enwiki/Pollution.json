	"summary": "Pollution happens when harmful things get into our environment and cause problems. It can be anything from dirty air and water to loud noises and plastic waste. Often, it's caused by human activities like factories and cars. Some pollution comes from one place (like a factory), while other types come from many places (like plastic in the ocean).\n\nPollution is really bad for people and nature. It can make people sick and hurt animals and plants. It's a big global issue, but rules and laws are helping to make things better. Many countries are working together to reduce pollution and protect our world.",
