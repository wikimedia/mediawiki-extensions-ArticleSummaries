	"summary": "A pager is a small device that receives messages, often used when quick alerts are needed. They can show text or even play voice messages. Some pagers can only receive, while others can reply or send new messages.\n\nThese devices work through a network of transmitters or base stations. They were very popular in the 1980s and 1990s but are less common now due to cellphones. However, emergency services still use pagers as they can be more reliable during disasters, providing better coverage than cell towers.",
