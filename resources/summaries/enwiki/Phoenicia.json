	"summary": "Phoenicia was an ancient civilization that lived near the Mediterranean Sea, mostly in modern-day Lebanon. They were great sailors and traders, spreading their culture across the sea. The Phoenicians were known for their alphabet, which became the basis for many modern scripts.\n\nThey lived in city-states, like Tyre and Sidon, and were very independent. Their power peaked around 900 BC but slowly declined due to outside influences. Despite this, their impact on trade, navigation, and writing remains significant, shaping the foundations of Western civilization.",
