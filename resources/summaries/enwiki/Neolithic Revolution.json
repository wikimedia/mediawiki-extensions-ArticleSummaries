	"summary": "The Neolithic Revolution, around 11,700 years ago, was when people in many parts of the world started farming instead of hunting and gathering. This let them settle in one place and grow crops, which led to bigger communities. Over time, these communities grew into villages and towns. People also began domesticating animals, making pottery, and using new tools. This change was crucial for the development of modern civilization, even though it initially reduced the variety and quality of food. It also caused populations to grow quickly in some areas.",
