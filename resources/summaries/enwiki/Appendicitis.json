	"summary": "Appendicitis happens when your appendix, a small pouch in your gut, gets inflamed. This often causes pain in the lower right belly, nausea, and loss of appetite. If not treated, it can burst, which is very dangerous.\n\nThe main cause is a blockage inside the appendix, often from hard poop (feces). This blockage leads to pressure, less blood flow, and bacteria growth, causing inflammation. Other reasons can be infections or parasites.\n\nDoctors usually diagnose it by symptoms, but tests like ultrasound or CT scans can help. Treatment is often surgery to remove the appendix. In some cases, antibiotics might also work. It's a common problem worldwide, affecting millions each year.",
