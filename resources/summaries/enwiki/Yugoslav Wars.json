	"summary": "The Yugoslav Wars (1991-2001) were a series of ethnic conflicts that led to the breakup of Yugoslavia into six independent countries. Tensions between different ethnic groups fueled the wars. The Yugoslav People's Army, initially aiming to keep Yugoslavia united, increasingly became a Serbian-Montenegrin force under Slobodan Milošević. The conflicts resulted in many deaths, severe economic damage, and war crimes, including genocide and ethnic cleansing. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia was established to prosecute these crimes. Estimates suggest around 140,000 people died in these wars.",
