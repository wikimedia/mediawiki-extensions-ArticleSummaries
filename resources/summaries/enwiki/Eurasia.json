	"summary": "Eurasia is the biggest land area on Earth, made up of Europe and Asia. Some experts think of it as one supercontinent. The idea of Europe and Asia as separate continents started in ancient times, but their boundaries have changed over time. Ancient Greeks, for instance, considered Asia to include Africa, while Europe was seen as a separate landmass. Eurasia is linked to Africa at the Suez Canal, and together they form the largest connected landmass, known as Afro-Eurasia.",
