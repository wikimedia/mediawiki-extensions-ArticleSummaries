	"summary": "Uncle Sam is a well-known symbol of the United States, often used to represent the government. The character was popularized by a World War I recruiting poster by J. M. Flagg in 1917. Flagg based his poster on an earlier British design and used his own face for Uncle Sam. The origin of the name is unclear, but it might be linked to Samuel Wilson, a veteran from the War of 1812. Uncle Sam is often shown alongside Columbia, who represents the nation, and Brother Jonathan, who symbolizes the American people.",
