	"summary": "The Pledge of Allegiance is a promise of loyalty to the U.S. flag and country. It was first written in 1885 by Captain George Balch, but Francis Bellamy revised it in 1892. Bellamy's version was used in a magazine promotion for a Columbus Day celebration in schools. Over 10,000 children recited it on October 21, 1892. Congress officially adopted it in 1942, and the words \"under God\" were added in 1954. There's a debate about who actually wrote it, as new evidence questions Bellamy's claim.",
