	"summary": "Holocaust denial is a harmful idea that says the Nazi's killing of Jews, called the Holocaust, never happened or was made up. Deniers often ignore the many historical facts and proofs. They might say things like there were no gas chambers or that not many Jews were killed. This is wrong and hurts the memory of the people who suffered and died. It is against the law in many countries because it spreads lies and hate against Jewish people.",
