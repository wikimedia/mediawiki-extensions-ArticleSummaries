	"summary": "Ball lightning is a rare and mysterious event where bright, round balls of light appear during storms. These balls can be tiny or huge, and they last longer than regular lightning. People have reported seeing them for centuries, and some even say they explode and smell like sulfur. Scientists are still trying to understand what causes this weird phenomenon, even though they've seen it and recorded its spectrum. So far, they've only been able to make similar effects in labs, but they're not sure if it's the same thing.",
