	"summary": "Escherichia coli (E. coli) is a rod-shaped bacterium commonly found in the intestines of warm-blooded animals. Most strains are harmless or even helpful, producing vitamin K2 or preventing bad bacteria from growing. However, some types can cause severe food poisoning. E. coli lives in the gut and is spread through feces. It can survive outside the body for a short time, making it a useful indicator of fecal contamination. Scientists have studied E. coli for over 60 years because it's easy to grow in labs and is a key model organism for understanding genetics and biotechnology.",
