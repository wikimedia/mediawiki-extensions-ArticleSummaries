Liverpool became important in the 1600s because of its port, which was busy with trade, including the slave trade. The city grew during the Industrial Revolution and got city status in 1880. Today, Liverpool is known for music (like the Beatles!), art, sports teams, and its diverse culture. It's also a popular place for tourists to visit.",
