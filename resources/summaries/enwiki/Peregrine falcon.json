	"summary": "## Peregrine Falcon\n\nPeregrine falcons are fast, bird-eating raptors found almost everywhere except the poles and rainforests. They're famous for diving at over 200 mph, making them the fastest animal. Females are bigger than males. They nest on cliffs or tall buildings and eat mostly birds, but sometimes small mammals or reptiles.\n\nPeregrines were endangered due to pesticides but have recovered thanks to protection and breeding programs. They're popular in falconry and have been important symbols in human history.",
