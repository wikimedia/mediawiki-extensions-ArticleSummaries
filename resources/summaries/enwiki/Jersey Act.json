	"summary": "## The Jersey Act: A Barrier for American Racehorses\n\nIn the early 1900s, British breeders worried about American horses' purity tried to stop them from being registered in the important General Stud Book. This \"Jersey Act\" said only horses with ancestors already in the book could be added. \n\nAmerican breeders were upset because many of their horses couldn't be registered. The rule stayed until 1949, partly because successful American horses proved their worth in Europe, and because British breeders needed new blood after World War II.",
