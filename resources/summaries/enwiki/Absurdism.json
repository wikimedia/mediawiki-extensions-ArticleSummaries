	"summary": "Absurdism is a philosophy that says life has no real meaning, and trying to find meaning can cause conflict. It's like when you want something to be true, but the world just doesn't make sense that way. Some people think this makes life absurd, or silly and pointless.\n\nAlbert Camus, a famous philosopher, talked about this a lot. He said people can respond to this feeling in different ways, like pretending it's not true, believing in something bigger, or accepting the absurdity. Even though life might seem meaningless, people can still find their own special meanings.",
