	"summary": "The Suez Canal is a man-made waterway in Egypt that connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea. It's 120 miles long and allows ships to travel between Europe and Asia without going around Africa. Built in the 1800s, it was a big project led by a French diplomat. Today, it's a super important route for trade, saving ships a lot of time and distance. Egypt controls the canal, but it's open to all countries. Recently, they made it wider and faster, helping even more ships pass through.",
