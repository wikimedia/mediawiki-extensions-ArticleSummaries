	"summary": "Propofol is a strong medicine that helps people fall asleep for surgeries or medical procedures. It's given through an IV and quickly makes people unconscious. This drug is unique because it's made with soybean oil and lecithin, giving it a milky look.\n\nDoctors like using propofol because patients wake up fast afterward and usually don't have many side effects. It's been around since the 1980s and is now a very common anesthetic, even having its own generic versions. The World Health Organization even lists it as an essential medicine.",
