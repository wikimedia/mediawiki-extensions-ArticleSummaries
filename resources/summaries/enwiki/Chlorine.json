	"summary": "Chlorine (symbol Cl) is a yellow-green gas with an atomic number of 17. It's a highly reactive element and a strong oxidizer, ranking high in electron affinity. Medieval alchemists used chlorine in experiments, but it was officially recognized in the 17th century. Confirmed as an element in 1810, it's named from the Greek word for \"pale green.\"\n\nFound mostly as ionic chloride compounds in nature, chlorine is essential for life as chloride ions. It's produced commercially from brine and used in various ways, including as a disinfectant, in bleach, and in making plastics like PVC. High concentrations are dangerous.",
