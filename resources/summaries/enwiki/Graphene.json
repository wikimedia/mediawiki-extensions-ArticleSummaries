	"summary": "Graphene is a super-strong and conductive material made of carbon atoms. It's like a single layer of graphite, but much stronger and thinner, just one atom thick! This makes it the thinnest 2D material. Graphene is transparent, but if you pile up many layers, it looks black. Scientists first thought of it in the 1940s, but it was only made and studied properly in 2004. Since then, people have won Nobel Prizes for their work with graphene, and it's becoming more popular in things like electronics and batteries.",
