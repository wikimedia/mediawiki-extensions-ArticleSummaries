	"summary": "Granite is a type of rock formed deep inside the Earth. It's made of minerals like quartz, feldspar, and mica, and it's very hard and strong. This rock slowly cools and hardens underground, creating large areas of granite called intrusions. Granite is common in the Earth's crust and is often used for building because of its durability. It can be various colors, typically has a grainy texture, and is found in many sizes, from small rocks to huge areas covering kilometers.",
