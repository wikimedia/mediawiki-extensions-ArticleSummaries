	"summary": "The Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland is a natural wonder made of around 40,000 basalt columns formed by an ancient volcanic eruption. These columns look like giant stepping stones leading into the sea. Most are hexagonal, but some have four to eight sides. Standing up to 12 meters tall, they attract over 998,000 visitors yearly, making it Northern Ireland's top tourist spot. It became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1986 and is mostly managed by the National Trust.",
