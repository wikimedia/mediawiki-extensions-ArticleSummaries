	"summary": "Fallen angels are angels believed to have been kicked out of heaven. The term isn't in Abrahamic religious texts, but it's used to describe angels who sinned and tempt humans. The idea comes from the Book of Enoch and Genesis. In Judaism and Christianity, these angels are linked to the \"sons of God\" and the Nephilim, giant creatures born to angels and human women. Islam has different views; some say Iblis (Satan) was an angel who fell, while others argue angels can't sin. The concept of fallen angels has been a fascinating topic in religious studies.",
