	"summary": "Fighter planes are designed for air battles. They help control the sky so other planes can safely attack enemy targets. These planes are super fast and can move quickly to avoid enemies.\n\nOver time, fighters have evolved. Some can do more than just fight in the air; they can also attack ground targets. There are different types, like interceptors and night fighters, each with unique jobs.\n\nIn a battle, a country's success in the sky depends on pilot skills, smart strategies, and how well their fighter planes perform.",
