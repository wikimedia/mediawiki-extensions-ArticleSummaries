	"summary": "Coeliac disease is an autoimmune condition where the body reacts badly to gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley. This causes damage to the small intestine, leading to problems like diarrhea, tummy pain, and poor nutrient absorption. Some people might not show typical symptoms and may have other health issues related to this disease.\n\nIt can affect people of any age and is linked to other autoimmune diseases. A gluten-free diet is the only treatment, helping to heal the intestine and improve health. It's important to get diagnosed, as untreated coeliac disease can cause serious health problems.",
