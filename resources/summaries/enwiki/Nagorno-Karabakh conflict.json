	"summary": "The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict is a long-running dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan over a region called Nagorno-Karabakh. This area was mostly home to ethnic Armenians, but it was officially part of Azerbaijan. The conflict started during Soviet times due to discrimination against Armenians living there. It escalated after the Soviet Union fell apart, leading to a war in the 1990s that Armenia and the ethnic Armenians won.\n\nIn 2020, fighting restarted, and Azerbaijan took back control of much of the region. Recently, in 2023, more fighting led to a ceasefire, but many Armenians had to leave, and the region is now under Azerbaijan's control.",
