	"summary": "Albert Einstein's famous formula, *E=mc²*, shows that mass and energy are interchangeable. This means a tiny bit of mass can create a huge amount of energy, and vice versa. Think of it as a super-powerful transformation!\n\nWhen something loses mass, it releases energy, like in nuclear reactions. This energy can be light or heat. This idea is crucial in understanding the universe, from tiny particles to massive black holes. Einstein's theory of special relativity led to this discovery, which has been proven by many scientists since.",
