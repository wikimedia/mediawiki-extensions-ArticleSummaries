	"summary": "String theory is a physics idea that imagines tiny, vibrating strings make up everything instead of tiny particles. These strings can look like regular particles from far away. The theory tries to explain gravity and other forces in one big theory, called a \"theory of everything.\"\n\nIt started in the 1960s as a way to understand nuclear forces but didn't work well. Later, scientists realized it could explain gravity in a quantum world. String theory has many versions and has helped with math and physics problems. However, it's still not proven and has some challenges, like describing many possible universes.",
