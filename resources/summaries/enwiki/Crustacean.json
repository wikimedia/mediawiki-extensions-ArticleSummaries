	"summary": "Crustaceans are a diverse group of aquatic animals, including crabs, lobsters, and shrimp. They are a type of arthropod with a hard outer shell, or exoskeleton, which they shed as they grow. There are over 67,000 known species, ranging from tiny 0.1 mm creatures to the massive Japanese spider crab. Most live in water, but some, like woodlice, are terrestrial. Some crustaceans are even parasitic or sessile, attaching to other animals or surfaces. This group has a long history, dating back to the Cambrian era, and is crucial to the food chain, with many being harvested for human consumption.",
