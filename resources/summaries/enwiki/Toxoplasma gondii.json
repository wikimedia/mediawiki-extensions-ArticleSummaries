	"summary": "Toxoplasma gondii is a tiny parasite that lives inside animals, especially cats. It can change how some animals, like rats, act, making them less scared of cats. This helps the parasite spread because cats eat the rats and the parasite can then reproduce inside the cat.\n\nIn people, the parasite usually doesn't cause problems, but it can be serious for babies and people with weak immune systems. Some studies suggest it might even change how we act, making us more likely to take risks. Many people around the world have been infected, but it's more common in some countries than others.",
