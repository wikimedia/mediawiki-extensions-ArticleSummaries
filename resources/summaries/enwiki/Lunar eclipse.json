	"summary": "A lunar eclipse happens when the Earth's shadow covers the Moon, making it look darker. This can only happen during a full moon when the Sun, Earth, and Moon are in a straight line. The Moon might turn red during a total eclipse due to the Earth's atmosphere bending the sunlight. Unlike solar eclipses, lunar eclipses can be seen from anywhere on Earth's night side and are safe to watch without special glasses. They can last up to two hours, much longer than solar eclipses.",
