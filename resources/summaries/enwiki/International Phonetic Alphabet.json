	"summary": "IPA is a special alphabet used to write down sounds from any language. It was created in the 1800s to help people learn and understand different languages' pronunciation. This system uses letters and symbols to represent speech sounds, like the \"ch\" in \"chat.\" It can be simple, like using one letter, or more detailed with extra marks for precise sounds. The IPA is updated sometimes, and now has over 100 letters and many symbols for different sounds and speech features. It's a useful tool for language learners, teachers, and linguists.",
