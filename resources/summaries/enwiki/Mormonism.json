	"summary": "Mormonism is a religious movement started by Joseph Smith in the 1800s. It's part of Christianity but has unique beliefs. Mormons believe in the Bible and the Book of Mormon, which tells stories of ancient Americans and their faith. They also have other special texts. Mormon theology teaches that people can progress spiritually and even become like God.\n\nThe church has different branches with some disagreements, mainly about polygamy (having more than one wife), which is no longer practiced by the largest group, the LDS Church. Some Mormons also have different views on the Christian concept of the Trinity (God as three in one).",
