	"summary": "Electromagnetic radiation, like light, is made of waves of electric and magnetic fields. These waves travel through space, carrying energy. They are produced by charged particles moving quickly. EMR includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet rays, X-rays, and gamma rays. Each type has a different frequency and energy level. Lower frequency waves, like radio and visible light, are non-ionizing and mostly just make things warmer. Higher frequency waves, like X-rays, are ionizing and can be harmful to living things.",
