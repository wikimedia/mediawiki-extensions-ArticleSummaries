	"summary": "Falafel is a popular Middle Eastern snack, originally from Egypt. It's made by shaping ground chickpeas or fava beans into balls and deep-frying them. These crispy treats are often served in flatbread with salads and sauces. You can find them as street food or as part of a meze (appetizer) platter.\n\nIn different countries, falafel can vary; Egyptians use fava beans, while Israelis and Palestinians prefer chickpeas. This difference has even led to debates about cultural ownership.",
