	"summary": "Habeas corpus is a legal way to ask a court to free someone from prison if they are being held unfairly. It's a powerful tool to fight against unlawful imprisonment. The court orders the prison official to bring the prisoner and explain why they are being held. If the reason isn't valid, the prisoner is released. Anyone can ask for habeas corpus, even if the prisoner can't do it themselves. This right is important to protect people's freedom.",
