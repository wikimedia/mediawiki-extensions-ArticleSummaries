	"summary": "Plato's \"Allegory of the Cave\" is a story told by Socrates to explain how education changes our understanding of the world. Imagine people chained inside a cave, seeing only shadows on the wall made by others outside. These shadows are their whole reality. Socrates says that true knowledge is like leaving the cave and seeing the real world outside, lit by the sun. Philosophers are like those who escape the cave, understanding the true forms of things, not just shadows. Some people in the cave don't even want to leave because they don't know there's a better reality outside.",
