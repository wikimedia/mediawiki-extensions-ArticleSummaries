	"summary": "LSD, short for Lysergic Acid Diethylamide, is a strong drug that makes you see, hear, and feel things that aren't really there. It can make you feel happy, scared, or like you're in a dream. Sometimes, it can even make you see things that aren't there, like colors and shapes. But be careful, it can also make you feel anxious or confused. \n\nLSD was first made in 1938 and was studied for possible medical uses, but it's now mostly used illegally for fun or spiritual reasons. It's very powerful, so a tiny bit can last for a long time, up to 20 hours. In many places, it's against the law to have or use LSD.",
