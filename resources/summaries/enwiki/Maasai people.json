	"summary": "The Maasai are an ethnic group living in Kenya and Tanzania. They have their own language called Maa, but many also speak Swahili and English. The Maasai have a unique culture and are known for their traditional way of life, including herding cattle. In Kenya, their population is over 1 million, but this number might be higher since some Maasai don't participate in government censuses. They are an important part of the East African cultural landscape.",
