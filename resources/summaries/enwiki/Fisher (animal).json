	"summary": "The fisher is a carnivorous mammal native to North America, belonging to the weasel family. It's the only living member of its genus and is sometimes called a fisher cat, though it's not a cat. Fishers are larger than martens and have several Native American names. They were heavily trapped for their fur in the 18th and 19th centuries, leading to local extinctions. Conservation efforts have helped them recover, but their range is still smaller. Fishers avoid humans but conflict can arise due to habitat loss. They mainly live in forests, eat small animals and plants, and rarely eat fish. Females give birth to 3-4 kits each year, with a long reproductive cycle.",
