	"summary": "Coulomb's law describes how charged objects interact. It states that the force between two charged particles is affected by the size of their charges and the distance between them. Like charges repel, and opposite charges attract. The force gets weaker as the distance between charges increases. This law was discovered by Charles-Augustin de Coulomb in 1785 and is crucial for understanding electromagnetism. It works similarly to gravity but with stronger forces and both attraction and repulsion.",
