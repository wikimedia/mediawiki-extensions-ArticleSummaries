	"summary": "The British Isles are a group of islands in the Atlantic Ocean, off Europe's northwest coast. They include Great Britain, Ireland, and many smaller islands. These islands have a long history, with ancient rocks found in Ireland and Scotland. The climate is mild, thanks to the North Atlantic drift.\n\nOver time, various groups like the Romans, Anglo-Saxons, Vikings, and Normans have influenced the region. The islands' political structure is complex, with the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland as sovereign states. The term \"British Isles\" is sometimes controversial, and alternatives like \"Britain and Ireland\" are used.",
