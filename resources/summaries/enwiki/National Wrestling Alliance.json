	"summary": "The National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) is an American wrestling organization started in 1948 to oversee regional wrestling promotions. It acted like a boss, making sure everyone followed the rules and recognized one world champion. Back then, it was the biggest deal in wrestling. But with the rise of big companies like WWE, many smaller promotions disappeared. In the 1990s, things changed, and NWA became a group of independent promotions. Over time, it evolved into a single promotion again, owned by Billy Corgan. Recently, in 2023, NWA brought back its old system, allowing different regions to have their own wrestling shows.",
