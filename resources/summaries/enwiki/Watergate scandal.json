	"summary": "The Watergate scandal happened in the 1970s during President Richard Nixon's time in office. It started when people broke into the Democratic Party's office in Washington, D.C., to steal secrets for Nixon's reelection campaign. When caught, they were linked to Nixon's team. Nixon tried to hide his involvement, but investigations found he had recorded conversations in the Oval Office that proved his guilt. As a result, Nixon resigned from being president, making him the only U.S. president to do so. This scandal led to many people being charged and convicted of crimes. The word \"Watergate\" is now used to describe any big, secret wrongdoings, especially in politics.",
