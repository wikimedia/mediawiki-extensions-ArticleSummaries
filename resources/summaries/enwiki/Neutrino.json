	"summary": "A neutrino is a tiny, neutral particle with a small mass that doesn't interact much with other matter. It gets its name from being electrically neutral and having a mass thought to be zero for a long time. Neutrinos are created in radioactive decays and nuclear reactions, like those in the Sun. They can pass through most things undetected due to their weak interactions. There are three types, or \"flavors,\" of neutrinos, and they can change between these flavors as they travel, a phenomenon called oscillation. Antineutrinos, the opposites of neutrinos, also exist.",
