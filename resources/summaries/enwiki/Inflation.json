	"summary": "Inflation means prices of items we buy are going up. It's like your money doesn't go as far as it used to. This happens when there's more demand for goods or less supply, like during an energy crisis.\n\nA little inflation is good for the economy. It helps people spend and invest money. But too much inflation is bad; it can lead to shortages as people buy things before prices rise more.\n\nCentral banks, like the Federal Reserve, control inflation by adjusting interest rates and managing money supply. Their goal is to keep inflation low and steady.",
