	"summary": "Quarks are tiny particles that make up protons and neutrons, which are found in the center of atoms. They come in six types, or \"flavors\": up, down, charm, strange, top, and bottom. Up and down quarks are the most common and stable. Quarks are never seen alone; they're always inside other particles. They have properties like electric charge and mass, and they interact through all four fundamental forces. Scientists first proposed the idea of quarks in 1964, and they've been studying them since.",
