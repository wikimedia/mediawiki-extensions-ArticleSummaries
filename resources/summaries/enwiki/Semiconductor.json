	"summary": "Semiconductors are special materials that can conduct electricity, but not as well as metals. They are found in between conductors and insulators. By adding tiny amounts of other elements (doping), we can change how well they conduct electricity. This makes them very useful in electronics.\n\nSilicon is the most common semiconductor, used in many electronic devices. Other examples include germanium and gallium arsenide. These materials have unique properties, like being able to control electricity flow and being sensitive to light and heat. These characteristics make them essential for modern technology, such as transistors and solar cells.",
