The main cause is breathing in asbestos dust, which can take 40 years to show symptoms. \n\nDoctors use X-rays and scans to diagnose it, and treatment includes surgery, chemo, and radiation. It's more common in older people, especially men, and is rare in Japan but higher in Australia and the UK.",
