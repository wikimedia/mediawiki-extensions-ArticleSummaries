	"summary": "A solar equinox happens twice a year when the Sun is directly above the Earth's equator. This creates equal day and night lengths worldwide. The terms \"vernal\" (spring) and \"autumnal\" equinoxes are used to describe the March and September events in the Northern Hemisphere, respectively. In the Southern Hemisphere, the opposite applies.\n\nThe equinoxes are significant as they mark the changing seasons and are crucial for understanding the Sun's path across the sky. They are defined by the Sun's position relative to the Earth's equator and are influenced by the Moon and planets' gravitational effects on Earth's orbit.",
