	"summary": "The golden eagle is a powerful bird of prey found in the Northern Hemisphere. With its distinctive golden-brown neck and dark brown body, it's an iconic species. These eagles hunt hares, rabbits, and squirrels using their speed and sharp talons. They live in large territories and build nests on cliffs. Golden eagles are monogamous and often mate for life, laying up to four eggs each spring. Once common across the Northern Hemisphere, they are now rarer in areas with human populations. They have a long history in falconry and are revered in many cultures.",
