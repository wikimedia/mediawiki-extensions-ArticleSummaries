	"summary": "Beef brisket is a cut of meat from the chest area of a cow. It's one of the nine main cuts of beef, but the exact definition varies worldwide. The brisket muscles support a lot of the cow's weight, so they have tough connective tissue. This means the meat needs to be cooked properly to make it tender. The name \"brisket\" comes from Middle English and Old Norse words for cartilage. It's located near the cow's sternum and ribs.",
