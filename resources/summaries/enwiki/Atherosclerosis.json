	"summary": "Atherosclerosis is a common disease where artery walls get damaged and build up with plaque, a mix of fat, cholesterol, and cells. This can narrow the arteries, affecting blood flow. It often starts in youth and gets worse with age, with most people having some plaque by 65.\n\nSymptoms may not show until middle age, but it can lead to serious issues like heart disease or stroke. Risk factors include bad cholesterol, high blood pressure, smoking, and family history. Eating right, exercising, and not smoking can help prevent it. Treatment may involve medicine or procedures to open arteries.",
