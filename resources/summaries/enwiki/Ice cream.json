You can eat it in a bowl with a spoon, in a crispy cone, or as part of other desserts. There are many types, like gelato in Italy or soft serve at amusement parks. Some are made for people who don't eat dairy, using goat milk or plant-based milks. Frozen yogurt and sorbet are also popular, fruity alternatives. The name \"ice cream\" can vary by country, with different rules for what it can be called.",
