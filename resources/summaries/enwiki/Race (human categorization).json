	"summary": "Race is a way to categorize people based on physical or social traits. It was first used in the 16th century and later became linked to physical appearance and national identity. Scientists now believe that race is a social construct, not a biological one. This means it's more about how society labels people than actual differences. The idea of race has been used to support racism, which claims some races are better than others. Today, many scientists avoid the term \"race\" as it can be misleading and prefer words like \"populations\" or \"ethnic groups.\"",
