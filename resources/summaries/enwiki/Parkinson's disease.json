	"summary": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a brain disorder that slowly affects movement and other body functions. Common signs are tremors, stiff muscles, and trouble balancing. As it progresses, it can cause problems with thinking, mood, and sleep.\n\nThe exact cause is unknown, but it involves the death of brain cells that make a chemical called dopamine. This leads to the symptoms. It usually starts after age 60, but some get it earlier.\n\nThere's no cure, but medicines can help control the symptoms. Over time, these may not work as well, and doctors might suggest brain surgery to improve movement. Eating right and therapy can also help.",
