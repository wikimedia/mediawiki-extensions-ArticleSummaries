	"summary": "Eid al-Fitr is a major Islamic holiday that marks the end of Ramadan, a month of daytime fasting. It's celebrated by Muslims worldwide on the first day of the month of Shawwal. The date varies each year because the Islamic calendar is based on the moon. During Eid al-Fitr, Muslims attend special prayers, often in open spaces, and exchange gifts and sweet treats. It's a time of joy, feasting, and spending time with family and friends. Some call it the \"Lesser Eid\" or \"Sweet Eid\" due to the focus on sweets and the smaller scale compared to Eid al-Adha, another Islamic holiday.",
