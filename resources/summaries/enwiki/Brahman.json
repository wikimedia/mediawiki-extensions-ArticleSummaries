	"summary": "In Hinduism, **Brahman** is like a huge ocean of everything that exists. It's the most important idea, representing the whole universe and everything in it. Think of it as the superpower that creates and connects everything, never changing but causing all changes. It's like a drop of water merging into the vast ocean, which is an analogy for the soul (**Atman**) becoming one with Brahman. This concept is found in ancient Hindu texts and is often described as truth, consciousness, and happiness.",
