It's made of numbers that don't get infinitely big when you apply a certain math operation over and over. \n\nWhen you zoom in, it reveals tiny, detailed patterns that repeat forever.  This makes it a \"fractal,\" like a tiny snowflake within a snowflake.  People like looking at Mandelbrot images because they're beautiful and surprising.",
