	"summary": "\"Middle-earth: Shadow of War\" is a 2017 action-adventure game set between \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\" movies. It's a sequel to \"Shadow of Mordor,\" following Talion, a Gondorian Ranger, and Celebrimbor's wraith as they make a new Ring of Power to fight Sauron. The game lets you command armies and has a unique \"nemesis system\" where you fight and recruit orcs. It's bigger and more colorful than its predecessor, with new mechanics and bigger maps. The game got good reviews, but some critics thought it had too many microtransactions and a bloated story. It was the top-selling game in the U.S. when it came out and got free updates and expansions after launch.",
