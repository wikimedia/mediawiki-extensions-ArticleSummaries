	"summary": "A thermonuclear weapon, also known as a hydrogen bomb, is a powerful type of nuclear weapon. It's like a two-stage rocket: first, a small nuclear explosion (the primary) creates a super-hot blast of X-rays. These X-rays hit the second stage (the secondary), which contains a fuel called deuterium and tritium. The X-rays squeeze the secondary, making its temperature soar and causing a massive fusion explosion.\n\nThis design is much more destructive than older nuclear bombs and uses less of the rare, expensive materials needed to make them. Most countries with nuclear weapons use this design for their larger bombs.",
