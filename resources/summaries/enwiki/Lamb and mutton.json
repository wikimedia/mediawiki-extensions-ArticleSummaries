	"summary": "Sheep meat is popular worldwide and is usually categorized into three types: lamb (from young sheep), hogget (from one-year-old sheep), and mutton (from older sheep). However, only \"lamb\" is commonly used by consumers, while \"hogget\" and \"mutton\" are less known. In some regions, \"mutton\" can mean goat meat. Lamb is the most expensive and is often the only sheep meat sold in stores. In Australia, \"prime lamb\" is a term for lambs raised for meat. Other languages have even more specific terms based on age, sex, and diet.",
