	"summary": "A solar eclipse happens when the Moon moves between Earth and the Sun, blocking the Sun's light. This happens about every six months during a special time called eclipse season. There are different types of eclipses: total, where the Sun is fully covered, and partial or annular, where only part of the Sun is hidden. Eclipses are rare and only visible from certain places on Earth. They have been seen as bad omens in some cultures, but scientists can now predict them accurately. Remember, looking at the Sun during an eclipse can harm your eyes, so use special protection when viewing.",
