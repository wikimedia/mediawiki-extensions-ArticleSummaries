	"summary": "Kepler's laws describe how planets move around the Sun. They were written by Johannes Kepler in the early 1600s. These laws changed how we understand planet orbits, showing they are elliptical, not circular.\n\nThe first law says planets' paths are ellipses with the Sun at one focus. The second law explains that planets move faster when closer to the Sun. Lastly, the third law states that the time a planet takes to orbit is related to its distance from the Sun. These laws were later proven by Isaac Newton's theory of gravity.",
