	"summary": "A helicopter is a type of aircraft that uses spinning rotors to take off and land vertically, hover, and fly in any direction. This makes them useful in places where regular planes can't go. The first mass-produced helicopter was the Sikorsky R-4 in 1942. Most helicopters have one main rotor and a smaller tail rotor to counterbalance the main rotor's spin. Some have two main rotors (bicopters) for heavier loads. Quadcopters, with four rotors, are also used for specific tasks like drone technology.",
