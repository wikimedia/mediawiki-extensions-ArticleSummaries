	"summary": "\"The Abduction of Proserpina\" is a big, beautiful sculpture by the Italian artist Bernini. Made from 1621 to 1622, it shows the god Pluto taking Proserpina to the underworld. Bernini was only 23 when he made it! The sculpture is super detailed, with Proserpina's tears adding to her expression. It was commissioned by a powerful cardinal and given to another as a gift. The marble looks like real skin, making the scene feel very lifelike.",
