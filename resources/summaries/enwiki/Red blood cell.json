	"summary": "Red blood cells, also called erythrocytes, are the most common blood cells in vertebrates. Their main job is to carry oxygen from the lungs to all parts of the body. They squeeze through tiny blood vessels, called capillaries, to deliver oxygen to tissues.\n\nThese cells are red due to a substance called hemoglobin, which has iron in it. Each red blood cell has around 270 million hemoglobin molecules! They are shaped like thin, flexible disks and don't have a nucleus or other organelles to make room for more hemoglobin.\n\nIn humans, new red blood cells are made every second, and they live for about 3 months before being recycled by the body.",
