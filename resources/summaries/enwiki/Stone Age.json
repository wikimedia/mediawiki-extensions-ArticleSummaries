	"summary": "The Stone Age was a long time ago, lasting about 3.4 million years. People used stone to make tools during this time. It ended when people started making tools out of metal, like copper and bronze. This period is divided into three parts: Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic. The Neolithic era saw people start to live in towns and farm, instead of just hunting and gathering. The Stone Age is an important part of learning about how humans lived in the past.",
