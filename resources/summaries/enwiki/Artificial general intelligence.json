	"summary": "AGI is a type of AI that can do almost anything a human brain can, like thinking, learning, and solving problems. It's different from regular AI, which can only do specific tasks. Scientists and companies are trying to create AGI, but it's really hard. Some people think we'll have it soon, while others say it might take a long time, maybe even 100 years or more. There's also a debate about whether it's safe to make AGI, as some worry it could be a risk to humans.",
