	"summary": "Lutheranism is a large Protestant religious group that began with Martin Luther's ideas in the 1500s. Luther wanted to change the Catholic Church, so he started the Reformation. Lutheranism became the official religion in many northern European countries.\n\nLutherans believe that the Bible is the most important source of religious truth, not church leaders or traditions. They also believe that people are saved by God's love, not by their own actions. Lutheran church services often include rituals and ceremonies similar to those in the Catholic Church, especially the Eucharist.",
