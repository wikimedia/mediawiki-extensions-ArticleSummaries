	"summary": "Jackals are dogs native to Africa and Eurasia. There are three main types: black-backed, side-striped, and golden jackals. They eat both plants and animals, hunt small creatures, and are good at scavenging. Jackals have long legs and special teeth for hunting. They are most active at dawn and dusk.\n\nJackals usually live in pairs and protect their area. Sometimes, they form small groups to eat large dead animals. Most jackals hunt alone or with one other jackal.",
