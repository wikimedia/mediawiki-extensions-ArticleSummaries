	"summary": "*Latrodectus* is a group of spiders with 34 species, including the well-known black widows and brown widows. They are found all over the world, with some in North America, Europe, Australia, and South America. These spiders are small but have powerful venom with a neurotoxin called latrotoxin.\n\nFemale true widow spiders have dark bodies and red, hourglass-shaped markings on their bellies. Their bites can be harmful to humans, but deaths are rare. Only female bites are dangerous, as their venom glands are larger. Despite their scary reputation, these spiders don't often cause serious problems.",
