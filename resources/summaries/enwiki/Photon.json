	"summary": "A photon is a tiny particle of light. It's like a tiny package of energy that travels through space. Photons are special because they have no mass and move super fast, at the speed of light. Scientists use the word \"photon\" to explain how light behaves, which can be a bit like a wave and a bit like a particle. Albert Einstein was one of the first to come up with this idea. Photons are important in many areas of science and technology, like lasers and quantum computers.",
