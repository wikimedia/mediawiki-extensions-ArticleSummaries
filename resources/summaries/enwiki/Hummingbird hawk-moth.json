	"summary": "The hummingbird hawk-moth (Macroglossum stellatarum) is a type of moth found in Europe and Asia. It looks like a hummingbird when it feeds on flower nectar using its long, straw-like mouthparts while hovering in the air. This similarity is not due to relatedness but evolved separately, a process called convergent evolution. First described in 1758 by Carl Linnaeus, its entire genetic code has been decoded since 2018.",
