	"summary": "The traditional Chinese calendar, used since the Han dynasty, is a combination of solar, lunar, and other cycles. It's known as a lunisolar calendar. This calendar is still used for social and agricultural purposes, like celebrating holidays and guiding farming activities. It's closely tied to the Chinese Zodiac, with each year and month associated with one of twelve animals.\n\nThe calendar system has evolved over time, with different dynasties and regions adopting variations. It uses a 60-year cycle of Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches for detailed date calculations. Today, while the Gregorian calendar is the official standard, many people still follow the traditional Chinese calendar for cultural and religious events.",
