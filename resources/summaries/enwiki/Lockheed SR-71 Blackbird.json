	"summary": "The Lockheed SR-71 \"Blackbird\" was a super-fast, high-flying spy plane used by the U.S. Air Force. Designed by Lockheed's Skunk Works, it could fly over 2,000 miles per hour (Mach 3.2) at over 85,000 feet. This speed let it avoid missiles and take photos for reconnaissance. Introduced in 1966, it was retired in 1998, with NASA using some until 1999. 32 were built, and it still holds world records for speed and altitude. Today, satellites and drones do its job.",
