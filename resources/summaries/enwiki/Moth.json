	"summary": "Moths are insects that aren't butterflies. They used to be grouped separately, but now they're all part of the same big family called Lepidoptera. Moths are mostly nocturnal, meaning they're active at night, but some fly during the evening or day. There are over 160,000 different types of moths, and scientists are still finding new ones.",
