Introduced in 1856 by Queen Victoria, it has been awarded 1,358 times. The medal is made from metal captured during wars, though its exact origin is debated.\n\nOver time, many Commonwealth countries created their own honors systems, including Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, each with their own version of the Victoria Cross. These awards recognize bravery and are highly valued, with some sold at auctions for large sums.",
