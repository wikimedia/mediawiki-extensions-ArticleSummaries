	"summary": "The Apocrypha are a set of ancient books written between 200 BC and 100 AD. These books are considered hidden or secret, from the Greek word \"ap√≥kruphos.\" Some Christian denominations, like Catholics and Orthodox churches, include them in their Old Testament. Protestants, however, place these books between the Old and New Testaments, calling them the Apocrypha, and consider them important but not part of the main canon. This collection has 14 books, offering additional historical and religious insights.",
