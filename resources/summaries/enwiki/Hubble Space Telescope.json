	"summary": "The Hubble Space Telescope, launched in 1990, is a powerful telescope in space. It's named after astronomer Edwin Hubble and is one of NASA's important projects. Hubble orbits Earth, taking clear pictures of space without the atmosphere getting in the way. It can see ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared light.\n\nHubble has helped scientists learn a lot about the universe, like how fast it's expanding. It's been repaired and upgraded by astronauts, and it's still working after 30 years. Newer telescopes, like the James Webb Space Telescope, are now being used alongside Hubble to explore space further.",
