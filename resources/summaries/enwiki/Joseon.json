	"summary": "The Joseon dynasty ruled Korea for 505 years, from 1392 to 1897. It was founded by King Taejo and replaced the Goryeo dynasty. Joseon moved its capital to Seoul and expanded its borders. The kingdom followed Confucian beliefs and discouraged Buddhism.\n\nThis period saw great cultural and scientific advancements. However, Japanese and Manchu invasions in the 16th and 17th centuries weakened Joseon. It became isolated but later experienced peace and development. In the 19th century, internal problems and foreign pressure led to its decline. Joseon's culture and language still influence modern Korea.",
