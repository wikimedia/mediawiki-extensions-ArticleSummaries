	"summary": "In 1938, Austria became part of Germany in an event called the Anschluss. This meant joining two countries to create a \"Greater Germany.\" The idea started after World War I when Austria wanted to unite with Germany, but it was not allowed by international treaties. Many Austrians and Germans supported this idea, especially as Austria struggled economically.\n\nAdolf Hitler, the German leader, made it a key part of his plan to expand Germany. He put pressure on Austria, and in March 1938, German troops entered Austria without any resistance. A vote later confirmed the union, though it was not a fair election.",
