	"summary": "The Panama Canal is a 51-mile-long waterway in Panama, connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. It was built to save ships time and avoid the long journey around South America. The canal uses locks to lift and lower ships to a lake, making it possible to cross between the oceans.\n\nFrance started building it in 1881 but faced challenges. The United States took over and finished the canal in 1914. It was a huge engineering achievement. Panama now controls the canal, which has seen millions of ships pass through. In 2016, they added a wider lane for bigger ships.",
