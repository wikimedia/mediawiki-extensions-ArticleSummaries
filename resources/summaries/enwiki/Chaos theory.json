	"summary": "Chaos theory studies systems that seem random but have hidden patterns. These systems are very sensitive to small changes, making long-term predictions hard, even though they follow strict rules. For example, a tiny change in a weather system's starting conditions can lead to vastly different forecasts. This is known as the butterfly effect, where a butterfly's wing flap in Brazil might cause a tornado in Texas. Chaos theory is used in many fields, like weather forecasting, heart rhythm studies, and even understanding traffic patterns.",
