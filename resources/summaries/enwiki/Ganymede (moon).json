	"summary": "Ganymede is Jupiter's biggest moon and the largest in our solar system. It's even bigger than the planet Mercury! Despite its size, it doesn't have a thick atmosphere like Earth. Ganymede has a unique magnetic field, caused by its liquid metal core. It orbits Jupiter in about seven days and has a special connection with two other moons, Europa and Io.\n\nThe moon's surface has two main types of landscapes: bright, grooved areas and darker, crater-filled regions. Scientists believe Ganymede's underground ocean might have more water than all of Earth's oceans combined! It was discovered in 1610 by Galileo and Simon Marius, who named it after a character in Greek mythology.",
