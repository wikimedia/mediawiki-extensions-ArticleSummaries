	"summary": "Maxwell's equations are a powerful set of math rules that explain how electricity, magnetism, and light work together. Named after scientist James Clerk Maxwell, they show how electric and magnetic fields are made by charges and currents. These equations are like a key that helps us understand many technologies, from motors to wireless communication. They also reveal that light is a type of electromagnetic wave, traveling at a constant speed. While they have been improved upon, Maxwell's equations remain crucial in physics and engineering.",
