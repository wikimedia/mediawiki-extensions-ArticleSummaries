	"summary": "Hadrian's Wall was a powerful defensive wall built by the Romans in AD 122, running across northern England. It stretched from the River Tyne to the Solway Firth, with deep ditches and forts along its length. The wall protected the Roman province of Britannia from northern tribes. Soldiers guarded the wall, and its gates likely controlled trade.\n\nAlthough much of the wall has been removed over time, many forts and museums along its route are open to visitors. Designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site, it remains a famous symbol of ancient Roman Britain.",
