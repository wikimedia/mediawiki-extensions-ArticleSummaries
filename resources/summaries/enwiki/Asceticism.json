	"summary": "Asceticism is a way of life where people choose to live simply and avoid worldly pleasures. They might give up possessions, food, or fun to focus on religion, prayer, or meditation. This practice is found in many religions like Buddhism, Christianity, and Hinduism. The goal is to find inner peace and connect with something greater. By limiting their desires, ascetics believe they gain more freedom and control over their lives. It's like a journey to discover what's truly important.",
