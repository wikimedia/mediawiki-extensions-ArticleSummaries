	"summary": "The Tokugawa shogunate was Japan's military government from 1603 to 1868, also known as the Edo shogunate. It was started by Tokugawa Ieyasu after winning a big battle. The Tokugawa family ruled Japan from Edo (now Tokyo) with the help of powerful samurai lords. They created a strict class system and mostly kept foreigners out to maintain peace. This period saw Japan's economy grow quickly, and a new merchant class emerged. The shogunate ended in 1868 when supporters of the emperor took over in the Meiji Restoration.",
