	"summary": "## French Open: A Tennis Super Bowl on Clay\n\nThe French Open is a super-popular tennis tournament held in Paris every year in late May. It's one of the four biggest tennis events (called Grand Slams) and the only one played on clay courts. This makes it really tough, as the clay slows down the ball and makes it bounce higher. It takes two weeks and seven rounds to find the champions. The tournament is named after a famous French pilot, Roland Garros.",
