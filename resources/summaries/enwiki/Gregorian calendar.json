	"summary": "The Gregorian calendar is the one most people use today. It was introduced in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII to replace the Julian calendar. The main change was to adjust leap years to make the average year slightly shorter, matching the actual time it takes for the Earth to orbit the Sun.\n\nThis reform was needed because the Julian calendar had too many leap years, causing the seasons and calendar dates to drift apart. The Gregorian calendar fixed this by skipping three leap days every 400 years. It was first used by Catholic countries and later adopted by most of the world.",
