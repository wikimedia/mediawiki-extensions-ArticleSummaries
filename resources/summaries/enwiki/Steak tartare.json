	"summary": "Steak tartare is a French dish made of raw, minced beef. It's often served with onions, capers, herbs, and spices, and topped with a raw egg yolk. The ingredients can be adjusted to taste. This dish is similar to some Middle Eastern, Turkish, and Korean raw meat dishes. Sometimes, the name \"tartare\" is used for other raw meat or fish dishes. In France, a variation called \"tartare aller-retour\" is slightly seared on both sides, leaving it mostly raw.",
