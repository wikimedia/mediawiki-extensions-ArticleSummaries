	"summary": "Fracking is a process where fluid is pumped into rocks under high pressure to release trapped oil and gas. It started in the late 1940s and has been used worldwide, especially in the U.S., to boost production from hard-to-reach reserves.\n\nThis technique has made the U.S. a significant oil exporter but has also sparked debates. Supporters emphasize economic gains and reduced reliance on coal. However, critics worry about environmental risks like water pollution, air pollution, and earthquakes. Studies suggest fracking can impact health, affecting pregnancies, causing headaches, and worsening asthma.\n\nDue to these concerns, fracking is regulated or banned in some places, while others, like the European Union, aim to control its use.",
