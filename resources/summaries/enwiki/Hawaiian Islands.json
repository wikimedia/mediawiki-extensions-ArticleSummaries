	"summary": "The Hawaiian Islands are a group of eight main islands, atolls, and small islets in the Pacific Ocean. They are named after the largest island, Hawaii. Once known as the Sandwich Islands, they are part of Oceania and sit on the Pacific Plate. These islands are the tips of a massive underwater mountain range formed by volcanoes. Hawaii, a U.S. state, covers most of the archipelago, except for Midway Atoll. It is the only U.S. state made up of islands and not connected to North America. The northwestern islands are protected as a National Monument.",
