	"summary": "The global financial crisis of 2007-2008 was a big economic problem. It started with risky loans to buy houses, especially to people with low incomes. Banks bought these loans and made them into investments, but when people couldn't pay their mortgages, these investments lost value.\n\nLehman Brothers, a big bank, went bankrupt because of these bad investments. This made the crisis worse, affecting banks worldwide. Governments helped by giving money to banks and making economic changes. The crisis led to a recession, causing job losses and other problems. New rules were made to prevent this from happening again.",
