With a population of 14 million, it gained independence from France in 1958. Guinea has faced military coups and authoritarian rule but held its first democratic election in 2010. Despite challenges like ethnic conflicts and corruption, it continues to hold multi-party elections. Predominantly Muslim, Guinea is divided into four geographic regions. French is the official language, but over 24 indigenous languages are spoken. Its economy relies on agriculture and mineral production, especially bauxite. However, poverty remains high, affecting over 66% of the population.",
