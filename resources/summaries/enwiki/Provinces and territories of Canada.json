	"summary": "Canada is made up of 10 provinces and 3 territories, which are like smaller governments within the country. It became a country in 1867 when three British North American provinces joined together. Over time, more areas were added, making Canada the second-largest country in the world. Provinces have more power than territories because they follow rules set by the Constitution Act. Territories get their power from the Canadian government. Each province has a representative of the king or queen, called a lieutenant governor. Territories have a commissioner who represents the federal government.",
