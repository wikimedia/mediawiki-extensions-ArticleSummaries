	"summary": "\"The Shining\" is a scary movie from 1980 directed by Stanley Kubrick. It's about a man, Jack Nicholson, who gets a job as a winter caretaker at a spooky hotel with his wife and son. As time goes on, he starts losing his mind. The film was mostly shot in a studio, and Kubrick made the actors do many takes, which was tiring. It used a new camera technique called Steadicam to make the scenes look smooth and realistic. Some people didn't like it when it first came out, but now it's considered one of the best horror movies ever. A sequel came out in 2019.",
