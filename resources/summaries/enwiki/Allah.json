It comes from an old Arabic term meaning \"the god.\" Before Islam, people in Arabia worshipped many gods, but \"Allah\" was the most important one. When Muhammad started Islam, he taught that Allah is the only true God. Today, some people in Muslim countries think that only Muslims should use the word \"Allah,\" but others believe it can be used by everyone.",
