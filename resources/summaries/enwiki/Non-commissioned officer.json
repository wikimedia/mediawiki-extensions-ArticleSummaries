	"summary": "Non-commissioned officers (NCOs) are military leaders who earn their rank by working their way up through the enlisted ranks. They are different from commissioned officers, who often attend military academies. NCOs include corporals and sergeants, and in some armies, warrant officers.\n\nNCOs are further divided into junior and senior/staff officers. They have authority over regular soldiers but are always junior to commissioned officers. In rare cases, an NCO might have some authority over a commissioned officer.",
