	"summary": "The Jurassic was a long time ago, about 201 to 145 million years ago. It's named after the Jura Mountains, where rocks from this time were found. The world was super hot, with no ice caps. The supercontinent Pangaea split into two big landmasses.\n\nDinosaurs became the stars of the show during this time, taking over from other reptiles. Birds also first appeared, coming from dinosaur families. Oceans were full of cool creatures like ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs. Plants were mostly ferns and conifers. Lots of new animals and plants evolved during this period.",
