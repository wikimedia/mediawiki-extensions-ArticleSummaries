The story, inspired by Russian and German folktales, is about Princess Odette, turned into a swan by an evil sorcerer. First performed in Moscow in 1877, the ballet is mostly staged today based on a 1895 revival by Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov. The music was updated for this version by Riccardo Drigo.",
