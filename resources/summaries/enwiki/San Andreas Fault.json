	"summary": "The San Andreas Fault is a huge crack in the Earth's surface, about 750 miles long, that runs through California. It's where two big plates of the Earth's crust meet. These plates move, causing earthquakes. The fault is divided into three parts, each with different risks. It starts near Eureka in the north and ends at the Salton Sea in the south. Professor Andrew Lawson discovered it in 1895 after studying the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Scientists continue to study this fault to understand how it works and to prepare for future earthquakes.",
