	"summary": "The Sun is a huge, hot ball of gas in the center of our solar system. It gives off light and heat, which is essential for life on Earth. It's a star, made mostly of hydrogen and helium, and is about 4.6 billion years old. The Sun is so big that about 330,000 Earths could fit inside it! It's also very far away, about 93 million miles from us. Scientists call it a \"yellow dwarf\" star, but its light is actually white. In the future, the Sun will get bigger and turn into a red giant, making Earth too hot for life.",
