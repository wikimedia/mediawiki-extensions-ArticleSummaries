	"summary": "The Velvet Underground was an American rock band formed in New York City in 1964. The original members were Lou Reed, John Cale, Sterling Morrison, and Angus MacLise (later replaced by Moe Tucker). Though they weren't very popular at first, they're now seen as one of the most important bands in rock and alternative music. They were known for their experimental sound and provocative lyrics. Andy Warhol managed the band and used them in his multimedia shows. Their debut album, \"The Velvet Underground & Nico,\" is now considered a classic. The band broke up in the 1970s but reunited briefly in 1993. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996.",
