It uses radio waves to send information and is limited to about 33 feet (10 meters). This technology is common in wireless earbuds and headphones, letting you listen to music or make calls without wires. The Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) controls how Bluetooth works and makes sure devices meet their standards. As of 2021, billions of Bluetooth chips are used every year.",
