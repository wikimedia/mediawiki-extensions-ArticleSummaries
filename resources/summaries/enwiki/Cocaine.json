	"summary": "Cocaine is a powerful stimulant drug made from the leaves of the coca plant, native to South America. It can make people feel happy and energetic but is often used illegally for its feel-good effects. Doctors sometimes use it as an anesthetic.\n\nWhen used, cocaine quickly gives a rush of energy and happiness but can also make people anxious or agitated. It works by changing how brain chemicals, like dopamine, work. Regular use can lead to addiction and serious health problems, including heart issues and even death. Mixing cocaine with other drugs is especially dangerous.",
