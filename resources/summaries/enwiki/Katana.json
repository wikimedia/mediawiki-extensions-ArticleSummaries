	"summary": "A katana is a traditional Japanese sword. It has a long, curved blade and is designed to be used with two hands. The sword was popular among samurai warriors. Katanas were made by changing older swords called tachi. The tachi's blade was shortened and the hilt was modified. In Japan, this specific type of sword is called \"uchigatana.\" The term \"katana\" is sometimes used for similar single-edged swords from other countries.",
