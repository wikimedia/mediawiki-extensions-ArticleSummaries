	"summary": "Taurine is a natural substance found in many animal bodies, especially in bile. It's named after the Latin word for bull, as it was first found in ox bile. Taurine is not something we need to eat because our bodies make it. It's even added to some cat and dog food. While it's sold as a supplement, there's no proof it helps our health. Interestingly, it's not found much in land plants but is present in high amounts in algae.",
