	"summary": "The Paleolithic, or Old Stone Age, lasted from about 3.3 million years ago to 11,650 years ago. It was the time when early humans first started using stone tools. They lived in small groups, hunting, gathering, and fishing. As time went on, their tools became more diverse and complex.\n\nHumans evolved during this period, with modern humans appearing by the Upper Paleolithic. They started creating art and showing signs of spiritual behavior. This era saw humans spread across the world, reaching Australia, Europe, Asia, and eventually the Americas.",
