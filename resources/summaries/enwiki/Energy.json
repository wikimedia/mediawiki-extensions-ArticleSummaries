	"summary": "Energy is the power that makes things work and move. It can be found in many forms like heat, light, and motion. The Ancient Greeks first used the word \"energy\" to mean \"activity.\" Energy can't be made or destroyed, only changed from one type to another. For example, a ball rolling downhill changes its stored energy (potential energy) into energy of motion (kinetic energy). The joule (J) is the unit we use to measure energy. Living things and our planet's climate depend on energy, especially from the sun.",
