	"summary": "Analgesics are medications that help relieve pain. They are different from anesthetics, which can numb or eliminate feelings. Analgesics are used to manage pain, and the type of drug depends on the kind of pain you have. For example, some antidepressants and anti-seizure drugs can help with nerve-related pain.\n\nYou can buy some analgesics, like certain anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), without a prescription. However, others are only available with a doctor's prescription because they can be risky and addictive if not used properly.",
