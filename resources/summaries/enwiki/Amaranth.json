	"summary": "Amaranth is a group of over 50 plant species found worldwide. They are known for their colorful flowers, leaves, and stems, ranging from maroon to crimson. These plants can grow up to 8 feet tall with a hollow, grooved stem.\n\nSome amaranth species are grown for their leaves, which are eaten as vegetables, while others produce grains used as food. They are related to Celosia plants and can be found on every continent except Antarctica, in various habitats. Certain species are native to North America and have either male or female flowers (dioecious), while most are monoecious, meaning they have both types of flowers on the same plant.",
