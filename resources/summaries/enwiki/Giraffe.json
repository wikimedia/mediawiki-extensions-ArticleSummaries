	"summary": "Giraffes are Africa's tallest animals, reaching great heights with their long necks and legs. They belong to the Giraffa genus and are known for their unique spots and horn-like structures called ossicones. These peaceful herbivores live in savannas and woodlands, eating leaves and fruits from tall trees.\n\nLiving in herds, giraffes have complex social structures. Males fight using their necks to establish dominance and mate with females. Sadly, giraffes are vulnerable to extinction due to habitat loss, with around 97,500 left in the wild. They are also found in zoos worldwide.",
