	"summary": "The Industrial Revolution was a huge change in how people worked and made things. It started in Britain around the 1760s and spread to other countries. Before, people made things by hand, but now machines took over, especially in the textile industry. Factories were built, and new power sources like steam and water were used. This led to more jobs, more people, and bigger cities.\n\nIt was a time of big changes, making life better for many but also creating new problems. It changed the world so much that it's considered one of history's most important events, after learning to farm.",
