	"summary": "Non-binary and genderqueer are terms for people whose gender isn't exclusively male or female. They might identify as both, neither, or somewhere in between. This is different from the gender they were assigned at birth, so many are under the transgender umbrella.\n\nNon-binary people can have different gender expressions and orientations. It's important to note that being non-binary is not the same as being intersex, as most intersex people identify as male or female. Some non-binary individuals seek gender-affirming care to ease gender dysphoria.",
