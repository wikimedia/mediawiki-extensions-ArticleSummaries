	"summary": "Kowloon Walled City was a crowded and lawless area in Hong Kong. It started as a Chinese military fort but became its own little city when the UK took over Hong Kong in 1898. After World War II, many refugees moved there, and by the 1980s, it was home to 35,000 people in a very small space. There were no rules, so bad things like drugs and illegal businesses happened. The British government decided to tear it down in 1987, and it was gone by 1994. Now, there's a park where the city used to be.",
