	"summary": "A nuclear family is made up of parents and their children living together. It's often called an \"atomic\" or \"conjugal\" family. This type of family usually lives in one home and may include biological, adopted, or stepchildren. Some people also consider single-parent families as nuclear families. The term became popular in the 20th century, but now, there are fewer nuclear families in North America, and more people are choosing different family structures.",
