Pope John XXIII wanted to update the Church to connect better with people in a changing world. The council made many changes, especially in how the Mass was performed. They allowed the use of local languages instead of just Latin. These changes made the Church's teachings and practices more accessible to everyone. Vatican II was an important event that brought new ideas and openness to the Catholic Church.",
