	"summary": "The Frye Fire was a big wildfire in Arizona in 2017. It started on Mount Graham after a lightning strike and burned for almost three months. The fire destroyed buildings, cost a lot of money to stop, and threatened an important observatory. Over 800 firefighters helped put it out, but some got sick with strep throat. After the fire, heavy rains washed away burned areas, causing problems like clogged creeks and damaged roads. The fire also hurt the home of a rare animal, the Mount Graham red squirrel.",
