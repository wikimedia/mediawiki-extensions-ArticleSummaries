	"summary": "Basque is a unique language spoken in a region between Spain and France, called the Basque Country. It's the only surviving language from ancient Europe, unrelated to any other language. Despite facing restrictions during Franco's rule in Spain, it's now thriving in schools and media. \n\nThe language has five dialects, but a standardized form, Euskara Batua, is widely used for official purposes. Basque is an agglutinative language, meaning words are formed by adding different elements, and it has a distinct grammar structure compared to most European languages.",
