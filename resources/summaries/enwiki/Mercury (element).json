	"summary": "Mercury is a unique metal with the symbol Hg and atomic number 80. It's the only metal that stays liquid at room temperature. It's also known as quicksilver and was once called hydrargyrum, from Greek words meaning \"water silver.\" Mercury is often found as cinnabar (mercuric sulfide) and is used in various ways, like thermometers and fluorescent lights. However, it's very toxic and can harm the nervous system and other organs, so its use is being reduced.",
