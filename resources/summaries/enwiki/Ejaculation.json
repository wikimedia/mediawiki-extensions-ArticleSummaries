	"summary": "Ejaculation is when semen (containing sperm) is released from a man's body through the penis. It usually happens after getting an erection and feeling sexually excited. Some men release a small amount of fluid before ejaculating. This process involves muscle contractions and is often linked with an orgasm. Ejaculation is important for having children. It can also happen during sleep. If ejaculation causes pain or doesn't happen at all, it could be a sign of a health issue.",
