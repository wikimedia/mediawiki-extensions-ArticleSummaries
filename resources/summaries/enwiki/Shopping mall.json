	"summary": "A shopping mall is a big indoor place to shop, often with large stores called department stores. The biggest mall in the U.S. is the Mall of America. The term \"mall\" was first used for walking paths with shops, but now it's for these big shopping centers. Malls are popular in many countries, but in North America, some have closed. To stay successful, malls add fun activities, big stores, or change to different types of shopping centers. In places like Canada, they might become mixed-use buildings with homes and shops.",
