	"summary": "The Tower of Babel story explains why people speak different languages. In the Bible's Book of Genesis, humans tried to build a tower to reach the sky. God, seeing their unity, made them speak different languages so they couldn't understand each other. This scattered them worldwide, leaving the tower unfinished.\n\nScholars think this story might be based on real places like Etemenanki, a tower in ancient Babylon, and events from Sumerian legends.",
