People think the legend might have started from sailors seeing giant squids, which can be up to 50 feet long.\n\nThe kraken was first written about in 1700 by Francesco Negri. Later, explorers like Hans Egede and scientists like Linnaeus might have also referenced it. The idea of the kraken as a dangerous, ship-sinking monster was popularized in French fiction by Victor Hugo and Jules Verne.",
