	"summary": "The human digestive system breaks down food into tiny parts so your body can use them. It includes your stomach, intestines, and some other organs. When you see or smell food, your body starts digestion in your mouth. You chew food, mixing it with saliva, which has special chemicals to start breaking it down. Then, it travels to your stomach, where it's mixed with acid to break it down more. Next, it moves to the small intestine, where most of the food is turned into energy for your body. Finally, the waste leaves your body as poop.",
