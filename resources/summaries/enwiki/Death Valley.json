	"summary": "Death Valley is a super hot and dry place in California, USA. It's famous for being one of the hottest spots on Earth, with a record high temperature of 134°F (56.7°C). The valley is also the lowest point in North America, way below sea level.\n\nThe name comes from some European pioneers who got lost there in the 1800s and thought they might die. But it's been home to the Timbisha Native American tribe for a very long time. Death Valley is now a national park, with cool mountains and unique desert life.",
