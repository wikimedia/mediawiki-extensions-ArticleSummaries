	"summary": "The Nakba refers to the tragic events in Palestine during and after the 1948 war. It describes the forced removal and persecution of Palestinian Arabs, with around 750,000 people displaced. Zionist and later Israeli forces were responsible for this ethnic cleansing, destroying villages and denying Palestinians their rights. This trauma is a key part of Palestinian identity, while some Israelis view it as part of their independence struggle, with debates continuing over the historical narrative. The Nakba is remembered annually on May 15th.",
