	"summary": "A unitary state is a country where the central government has all the power and can make all the important decisions. This government can create or get rid of local government divisions as it sees fit, and these local governments only have the power given to them by the central government. The idea of unitary states started in France after the Hundred Years' War, when the country became more unified. France then spread this system to other parts of Europe and the world through its colonial empire. Most countries in the world, 166 out of 193, have a unitary system of government.",
