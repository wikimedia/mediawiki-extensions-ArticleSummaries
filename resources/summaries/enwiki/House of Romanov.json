	"summary": "The House of Romanov ruled Russia from 1613 to 1917. It began when Michael Romanov became tsar after a difficult period called the Time of Troubles. The Romanovs became powerful under Peter I, who made Russia a major world power. The family's direct male line ended with Elizabeth, and her nephew, Peter III, took over. The Romanov rule ended with Nicholas II's abdication during the February Revolution in 1917. The Bolsheviks later executed Nicholas II and his family. Most Romanovs fled Russia, and one of Elizabeth's descendants later claimed leadership of the imperial house.",
