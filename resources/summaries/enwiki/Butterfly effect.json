	"summary": "The butterfly effect is a concept in chaos theory, named after mathematician Edward Lorenz's idea that a butterfly flapping its wings could influence the weather. It describes how tiny changes in initial conditions can lead to vastly different outcomes in complex systems. For example, a small difference in a double pendulum's starting position can result in vastly different movements over time. This effect highlights the unpredictable nature of certain systems, where small causes can have significant effects.",
