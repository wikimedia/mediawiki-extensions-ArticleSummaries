	"summary": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a gas made of one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms. It's crucial for life, as plants use it in photosynthesis, and it's also a greenhouse gas, trapping heat in the atmosphere. CO2 dissolves in water, contributing to ocean acidification. Its level in the air has increased due to burning fossil fuels, causing climate change. This gas has many uses, like in welding, fire extinguishers, and making fizzy drinks. Though it has a sharp smell, in the air, it's usually odorless.",
