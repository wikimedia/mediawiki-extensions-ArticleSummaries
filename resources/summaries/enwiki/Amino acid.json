	"summary": "Amino acids are organic compounds with both amino and carboxylic acid groups. There are over 500 types, but only 22 are used to build proteins, which are essential for human muscles and tissues. These 22 amino acids are also known as Î±-amino acids. They can be categorized based on their structure and side-chain groups. The IUPAC-IUBMB Joint Commission names them using a \"neutral\" structure, like 2-aminopropanoic acid for alanine, to simplify naming and understanding their roles in various processes, including helping life on Earth evolve.",
