	"summary": "A composite number is a whole number that can be made by multiplying two smaller numbers. For example, 10 is composite because it's 2 x 5. Prime numbers, like 2 and 3, can only be divided by 1 and themselves, so they aren't composite.\n\nYou can spot composite numbers because they can be arranged into rectangles using Cuisenaire rods. The first few composite numbers are 4, 6, 8, 9, and 10. There are many more, up to 150 and beyond.\n\nComposite numbers are important in math, and we can test if a number is composite or prime.",
