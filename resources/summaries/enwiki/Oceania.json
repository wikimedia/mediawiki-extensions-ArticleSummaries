It's the smallest continent in size but has a unique mix of cultures and economies. Some areas, like Australia and Hawaii, are highly developed, while others are less so. \n\nPeople have lived in Oceania for over 60,000 years, and European explorers discovered these lands from the 16th century. The region has a rich history, with Aboriginal Australian rock art being the world's oldest continuous art form. Today, many Oceanian countries are democratic and rely on tourism as a main source of income.",
