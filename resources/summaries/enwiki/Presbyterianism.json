	"summary": "Presbyterianism is a Protestant religion with around 75 million followers worldwide. It's known for its church government led by elected elders, called presbyters. The name comes from the Greek word for \"elder.\" This structure was inspired by the teachings of John Calvin and the Reformation in the 16th century.\n\nPresbyterians believe in one God, the authority of the Bible, and salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. The burning bush is a symbol often used, representing God's presence and protection. Many Presbyterians can trace their history back to Scotland and English Dissenters during the English Civil War.",
