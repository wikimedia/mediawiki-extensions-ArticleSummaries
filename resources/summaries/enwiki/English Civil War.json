	"summary": "The English Civil War (1642–1651) was a conflict between the Royalists (supporting the king) and Parliamentarians in England. It was part of a larger war involving Scotland and Ireland. The war had two main parts: the First and Second English Civil Wars. The fight was about power—who had more control, the king (Charles I) or Parliament.\n\nIn the end, the Parliamentarians won, and Charles I was executed. This led to the creation of the Commonwealth of England. Later, Charles II became king of Scotland, but was defeated by Parliament in the Anglo-Scottish War. After this, Ireland and Scotland joined the Commonwealth, making Britain a single country until 1660.",
