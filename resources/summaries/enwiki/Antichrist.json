	"summary": "In Christian belief, the Antichrist is a person who will oppose Jesus Christ. This idea is found in the Bible, especially in the New Testament books of 1st and 2nd John. The Antichrist is described as someone who denies God and might pretend to be a savior before Jesus' return.\n\nThe concept is linked to other biblical figures like the \"false Christs\" mentioned by Jesus in the Gospels, the \"little horn\" in the Book of Daniel, and the \"man of sin\" in Paul's letters. These descriptions create a picture of a powerful and deceptive figure in the end times.",
