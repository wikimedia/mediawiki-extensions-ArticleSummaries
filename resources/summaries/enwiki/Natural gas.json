	"summary": "Natural gas is a type of fossil fuel made from decomposed organic matter. It's mostly methane (95%) and is found underground. This gas is used for heating, cooking, and making plastics. It's considered a cleaner fuel than coal or oil because it produces less pollution when burned. However, it still contributes to climate change due to greenhouse gases.\n\nNatural gas forms over millions of years under high heat and pressure. It's often found with other fossil fuels. Before use, it needs to be processed to remove impurities. It's measured in cubic meters or feet.",
