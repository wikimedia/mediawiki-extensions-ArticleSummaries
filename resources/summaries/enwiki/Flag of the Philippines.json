	"summary": "The Philippine flag is a simple design with powerful symbols. It has two equal horizontal bands of royal blue and crimson red, and a white triangle at the side. In the triangle, there's a golden sun with eight rays, representing the eight provinces that started the 1896 revolution. Three golden stars at the corners stand for the main island groups: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The white triangle symbolizes freedom and equality. Interestingly, flipping the flag to show red on top signals a state of war.",
