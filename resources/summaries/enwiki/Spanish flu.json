It started in 1918 and spread quickly, with over 500 million people getting sick in just two years. This pandemic was very dangerous, leading to the deaths of 17 to 50 million people, maybe even more.\n\nThe flu hit young adults hard, which was unusual. War conditions at the time made things worse, with crowded hospitals and poor health conditions. The pandemic's name came from newspaper reports in Spain, even though it likely started elsewhere.",
