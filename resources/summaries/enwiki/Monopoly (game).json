Players move around the board using dice, collect rent, and can go to \"jail.\" The game is about becoming rich and has different rules and editions worldwide.\n\nOriginally based on Atlantic City, it was derived from a game called *The Landlord's Game* created by Lizzie Magie in 1903 to show the negative effects of monopolies. Parker Brothers published Monopoly in 1935, and it's now owned by Hasbro.",
