	"summary": "Sex is a trait that determines an organism's reproductive role. During sexual reproduction, male and female gametes (sperm and eggs) fuse to create an offspring that inherits traits from both parents. Organisms are typically classified as male or female based on the type of gametes they produce. The sex of an individual is influenced by biological sex-determination systems, such as chromosomes in mammals or environmental factors in reptiles. Sexual selection can lead to physical differences between males and females, known as sexual dimorphism, which helps in identifying their sex. Some species, like fungi, have mating types instead of traditional male and female roles.",
