	"summary": "A chromosome is like a DNA package that holds an organism's genetic information. In eukaryotic cells, DNA is wrapped around proteins called histones, forming a tight structure. This helps keep the DNA safe and organized. During cell division, chromosomes become very compact, making them visible under a microscope. They look like an \"X\" or a two-armed structure due to a central point called the centromere. These structures are important for genetic diversity and can sometimes lead to health issues if they're not formed correctly.",
