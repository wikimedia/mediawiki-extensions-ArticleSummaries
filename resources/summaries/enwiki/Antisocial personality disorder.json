	"summary": "ASPD is a mental health condition where people have trouble understanding others' feelings and often behave in harmful ways. It starts before age 15 and includes symptoms like being impulsive, reckless, and aggressive. People with ASPD might not feel guilty after hurting someone and may lie and act irresponsibly. It's more common in young adults, especially males, and affects about 1-4% of people in the U.S. It's different from just being asocial, which means not liking social activities.",
