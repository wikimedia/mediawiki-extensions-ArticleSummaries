	"summary": "Aesthetics is a type of philosophy that explores what makes things beautiful and why we appreciate art. It looks at how we judge and enjoy art, music, nature, and even fashion. This includes understanding our reactions to different forms of art and why we prefer certain things. Aesthetics also asks big questions like, \"What is art?\" and \"What makes a piece of art good?\" It helps us think deeply about our experiences and feelings towards the world around us.",
