They eat mostly fish, which they catch with their sharp talons. These eagles build huge nests in tall trees, the biggest of any bird in North America.\n\nAlthough they're called \"bald,\" they actually have white heads.  They were almost extinct in the U.S. but are now making a comeback thanks to conservation efforts.  They are an important symbol of the United States.",
