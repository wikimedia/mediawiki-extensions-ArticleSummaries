	"summary": "\"Loss\" is a four-panel comic by Tim Buckley from the webcomic Ctrl+Alt+Del. It shows the main character, Ethan, finding his fianc√©e Lilah crying in a hospital bed after a miscarriage. There's no dialogue, just a powerful, sad moment. Some people didn't like how the comic suddenly got serious and used Lilah's injury to make Ethan's story more dramatic. Despite the criticism, \"Loss\" became a well-known internet meme and was turned into many parodies.",
