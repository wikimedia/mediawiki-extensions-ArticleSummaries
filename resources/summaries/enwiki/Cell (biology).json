	"summary": "Cells are the tiny, yet powerful, units that make up all living things. They are so small that most can only be seen with a microscope. There are two main types: eukaryotic cells (found in plants, animals, and fungi) and prokaryotic cells (like bacteria). Eukaryotic cells have a control center called a nucleus, while prokaryotic cells do not. Cells do many important jobs, like making energy and proteins. They can also copy themselves, allowing living things to grow and repair. The study of cells began in 1665 when Robert Hooke first discovered them.",
