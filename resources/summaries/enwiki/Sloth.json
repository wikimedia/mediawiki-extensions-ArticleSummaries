	"summary": "Sloths are slow-moving mammals found in the rainforests of South and Central America. They hang upside down in trees and have either two or three toes on each limb. Sloths are related to anteaters and have a low metabolism, which is why they move slowly and are called \"lazy.\" Their shaggy coat has green algae that help camouflage them and provide extra nutrients. Sloths used to be much larger and lived in North America too, but they went extinct around 12,000 years ago, possibly due to climate change and humans.",
