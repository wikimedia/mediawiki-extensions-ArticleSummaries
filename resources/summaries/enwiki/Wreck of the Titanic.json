	"summary": "The RMS Titanic, a British ocean liner that sank in 1912, lies about 690 kilometers off the coast of Newfoundland at a depth of around 3,800 meters. The ship is broken into two main pieces with a debris field nearby. The bow is mostly intact, while the stern is heavily damaged. Many items from the ship are preserved in the debris. The wreck was found in 1985 by a French-American expedition. It has since been visited by many expeditions, but raising it is not possible due to its fragility and is protected by UNESCO.",
