	"summary": "Christian Science is a religion started in 1879 by Mary Baker Eddy. It's based on her book, *Science and Health*, and the Bible. The church believes that reality is spiritual, and illness is a mental mistake. They pray for healing instead of using doctors.\n\nThe religion grew quickly in the U.S., but membership has dropped. The church has a famous newspaper, *The Christian Science Monitor*, and unique ideas about Jesus and Christian beliefs. While they don't ban medical care, they prefer prayer, which has led to some legal issues.",
