	"summary": "The pineal gland is a tiny gland in the brain of most animals with backbones. It looks like a pine cone, hence its name. Its main job is to make a hormone called melatonin, which helps control our sleep patterns. It's located near the center of the brain. While most vertebrates have it, some simpler animals don't.\n\nAncient Greeks and Romans knew about this gland, but it wasn't until the 20th century that scientists understood its role in the body.",
