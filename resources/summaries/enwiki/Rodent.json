	"summary": "Rodents are a diverse group of mammals, making up about 40% of all mammal species. They are found almost everywhere except Antarctica and some oceanic islands. These animals have a unique feature: a single pair of constantly growing front teeth (incisors) in both their upper and lower jaws.\n\nWell-known rodents include mice, rats, squirrels, and hamsters. They live in various habitats, from trees to burrows and even in water. Rodents use their strong incisors to eat, dig, and protect themselves. Most are small, social animals that eat plants, but their diets can vary.\n\nRodents have a long history, dating back millions of years, and have spread across the world, sometimes even traveling across oceans.",
