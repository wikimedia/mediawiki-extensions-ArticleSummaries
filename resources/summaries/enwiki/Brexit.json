	"summary": "Brexit is when the United Kingdom (UK) left the European Union (EU) in 2020. The UK joined the EU in 1973 but decided to leave after a vote in 2016. This was because some people in the UK didn't agree with the EU's rules and wanted more control over their own laws. The decision to leave was close, with 51.9% voting to leave and 48.1% voting to stay. It took four years to negotiate the terms of the UK's departure. After leaving, the UK and EU had to agree on new trade rules and how they would work together.",
