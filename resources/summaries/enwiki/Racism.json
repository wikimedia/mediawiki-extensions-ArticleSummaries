It's like having a bias against someone just because they look different or come from a different background. Racism can be seen in many ways, like in laws, social rules, or even how people act. It's often based on the idea that some groups are better than others, which is not true. Racism has been used to justify bad things like slavery, discrimination, and even violence against certain groups. It's a big problem that has affected many lives and societies around the world.",
