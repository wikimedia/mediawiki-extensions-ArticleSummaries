	"summary": "Arthropods are a diverse group of invertebrates, including insects, spiders, and crabs. They have a hard outer skeleton and a body made of connected segments. Arthropods grow by shedding their old skeleton and growing a new one. They have a unique circulatory system with a fluid called haemolymph. Their eyes can be simple or complex, and they have sensitive bristles for sensing their environment. Arthropods reproduce in various ways, often laying eggs. They have a long evolutionary history and are important for pollination and as food sources, but some can also spread diseases.",
