	"summary": "Autocracy is a government type where one person, called an autocrat, has complete control. It's different from democracy or feudalism. Autocrats can be single rulers or a group. They decide how much freedom people have. Some autocracies pretend to be democratic with fake elections.\n\nAutocrats stay in power by controlling people with propaganda and stopping anyone else from becoming too powerful. They often use ideas like ideology, religion, or enemies to seem legitimate. This type of government is very old, starting with ancient empires and kings. Today, most are authoritarian, not totalitarian.",
