	"summary": "Carbonated water, like sparkling mineral water or club soda, has carbon dioxide gas dissolved in it, making it fizzy. This gas can be added artificially or occur naturally. Sometimes, minerals like potassium or sodium are also added for flavor. People have been making this type of water since the 1700s, with Joseph Priestley being the first to do so accidentally. His discovery later led to the creation of the soft drink industry.",
