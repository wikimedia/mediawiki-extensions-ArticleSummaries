	"summary": "Barbados is an island country in the Caribbean, east of the other islands. It was first inhabited by Indigenous people, then claimed by Spain and Portugal before becoming a British colony in 1625. The economy relied on plantations worked by enslaved Africans until slavery was abolished in the 1830s. Barbados gained independence in 1966 and became a republic in 2021. Most people in Barbados have African ancestry, and it's a popular tourist spot.",
