	"summary": "A coup is when a group, often the military, tries to take control of a government illegally. This can happen when leaders want to stay in power after their term ends. There have been many coups around the world, especially in the 1960s and 1970s. Sometimes, coups lead to democracy, but most often, they result in authoritarian rule.\n\nTo succeed, coup leaders must make people believe they can take over. Over time, fewer coups have been successful. Governments often try to prevent coups by placing loyal people in important positions, but this can make the military less effective.",
