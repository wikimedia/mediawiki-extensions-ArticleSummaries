	"summary": "In 1908, a massive explosion happened in Russia, near the Tunguska River. It was caused by an asteroid that broke apart in the sky, without actually hitting the ground. This event flattened millions of trees and would have been powerful enough to destroy a big city. It's considered the biggest known impact event on Earth, even though it happened in a remote area, and no one was badly hurt. Scientists estimate the asteroid was about 50-60 meters wide and traveled very fast.",
