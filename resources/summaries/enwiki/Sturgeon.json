	"summary": "Sturgeon is a type of fish with 28 species in the Acipenseridae family. They have been around for millions of years and are found in rivers, lakes, and coastlines in Eurasia and North America. Sturgeons have a unique body shape, smooth skin, and bony plates called scutes. Some can grow very large, up to 23 feet long! They often live in freshwater but migrate to the ocean to breed.\n\nSturgeons are important as their eggs, called caviar, are a luxury food. However, this has led to overfishing, and many sturgeon species are now in danger of becoming extinct.",
