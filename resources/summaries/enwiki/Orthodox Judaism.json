	"summary": "Orthodox Judaism is a traditional form of Judaism that believes the Torah was given by God to Moses. They follow Jewish law (halakha) strictly, based on ancient teachings. This includes keeping the Sabbath, eating kosher food, and studying the Torah. They expect a future Messiah to unite Jews in Israel.\n\nThere are different groups, like Haredi, who live separately and follow very strict rules, and Modern Orthodox Jews, who balance tradition with modern life. Despite differences, all Orthodox Jews believe the Torah is divine and unchangeable. This faith has grown, with over two million followers worldwide.",
