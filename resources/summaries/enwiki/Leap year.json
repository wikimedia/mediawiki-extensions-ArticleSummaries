	"summary": "A leap year is a special year with an extra day, making it 366 days long instead of 365. This extra day helps keep our calendars in sync with the actual time it takes for Earth to go around the Sun, which is slightly less than 365 and a quarter days. The most common leap year pattern is every four years, like in the Gregorian calendar used worldwide. Some calendars, like the Hebrew one, add an extra month instead of a day. The term \"leap year\" comes from how the extra day makes the days of the week \"leap\" ahead by two days instead of one.",
