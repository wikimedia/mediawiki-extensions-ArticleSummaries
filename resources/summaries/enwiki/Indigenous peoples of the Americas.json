They are diverse, with some living as hunter-gatherers and others farming or doing aquaculture. Many had complex societies with advanced knowledge in various fields like math, writing, and engineering.\n\nToday, Indigenous people live across the Americas, especially in Bolivia, Canada, and Mexico. They speak over a thousand languages, and many still practice their traditional cultures. Some have mixed with European or other groups, known as mestizos. Recently, more people are claiming their Indigenous heritage.",
