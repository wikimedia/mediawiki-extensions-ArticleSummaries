	"summary": "The Greek alphabet has been used since around 900-800 BC and comes from the Phoenician alphabet. It was the first alphabet to have separate letters for vowels and consonants. Over time, many local versions existed, but by 300 BC, the standard 24-letter alphabet, ordered from alpha to omega, was established. This is still used for Greek writing today. The Greek alphabet is the origin of the Latin and Cyrillic scripts. It's also used for technical symbols in math and science.",
