	"summary": "A Ponzi scheme is a type of fraud where investors are tricked into thinking their money is making profits from legitimate business. Instead, early investors are paid with the money from new investors. It's named after Charles Ponzi, who did this in the 1920s. Similar schemes happened earlier, like in the 1800s with Adele Spitzeder and Sarah Howe. These scams work as long as new investors keep coming, but they eventually collapse when people ask for their money back.",
