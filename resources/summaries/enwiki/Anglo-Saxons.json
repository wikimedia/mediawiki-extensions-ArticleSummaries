	"summary": "The Anglo-Saxons were a group of people who lived in England during the Early Middle Ages. They came from Germanic settlers and spoke Old English. Their culture started around the 5th century and lasted until 1066, when the Normans invaded. By then, most people in England spoke Old English and considered themselves English.\n\nAnglo-Saxon culture is known for its art, like illuminated texts and metalwork, which often showed tribal and leadership ties. They built fortified settlements called burhs, and their leaders called themselves kings. Even after the Norman Conquest, the Anglo-Saxon identity remained strong.",
