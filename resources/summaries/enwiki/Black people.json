	"summary": "\"Black\" is a term used to describe people with dark skin, often those with African ancestry. However, it doesn't just depend on skin color; it's also about how society sees and groups people. The meaning of \"black\" can change in different countries and has a complex history. For some, it's a label they don't want to use because it can be offensive or too simple to describe diverse groups of people. Recently, some style guides have started capitalizing \"Black\" to show respect and recognize the experiences of Black people.",
