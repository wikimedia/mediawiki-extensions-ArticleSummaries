This genre is recognized for its simple songs, folk-inspired lyrics, and instruments like banjos, fiddles, and guitars. Originally called \"hillbilly music,\" it later merged with western music and became popular in the 1940s. Today, country music remains one of the most-listened-to genres during commute hours in the United States.",
