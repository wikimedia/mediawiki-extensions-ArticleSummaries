	"summary": "Black metal is an extreme type of rock music with fast beats, high-pitched singing, and loud, distorted guitars. It often has a dark, atmospheric sound and is recorded with simple equipment. Bands often use scary face paint and fake names. The genre started in the 1980s with bands like Venom and Bathory. It became more popular in the 1990s, especially in Norway with bands like Mayhem and Darkthrone. Black metal sometimes causes controversy because some bands promote Satanism, anti-Christian beliefs, or even commit crimes. Despite this, it remains an underground music style.",
