	"summary": "Mahavira, born in the 6th century BCE, was the 24th Tirthankara (spiritual teacher) of Jainism. He was a prince who gave up his royal life to seek enlightenment, becoming an ascetic. After years of meditation and austerities, he achieved omniscience and taught for 30 years.\n\nHis teachings focused on self-realization, non-violence, truth, and detachment from material possessions. Mahavira's followers compiled his teachings as the Jain Agamas. He is often depicted in meditative poses with a lion symbol. Jains celebrate his birth and liberation with festivals like Mahavir Janma Kalyanak and Diwali.",
