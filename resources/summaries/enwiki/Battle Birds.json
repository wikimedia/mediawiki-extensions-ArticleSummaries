	"summary": "\"Battle Birds\" was an American adventure magazine about air wars, published in two periods: 1932-1935 and 1940-1944. Initially, it struggled to sell, so the publisher changed it to a hero pulp called \"Dusty Ayres and His Battle Birds\" in 1934. Writer Robert Sidney Bowen created stories set in the future where the US fought an Asian empire. Despite the change, the magazine stopped in 1935. It restarted in 1940, returning to its original title, and continued for four more years.",
