	"summary": "Human history starts with our ancestors in Africa over 300,000 years ago. They spread across the world during the Ice Age. A big change happened with the Neolithic Revolution, when people started farming instead of hunting. This led to the rise of ancient civilizations in places like Mesopotamia and Egypt around 3500 BCE.\n\nOver time, these societies developed writing, religion, and powerful empires. The post-classical period saw the growth of Islam and Christianity. From 1500, Europe's exploration and colonization impacted the world. This led to the Industrial Revolution, starting around 1800, which changed how we live and work. Today, our world is more connected than ever, with rapid growth in technology and global interactions.",
