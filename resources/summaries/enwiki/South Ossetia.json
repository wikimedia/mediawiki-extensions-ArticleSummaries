	"summary": "South Ossetia, officially the Republic of South Ossetia, is a small, landlocked country in the South Caucasus region. It has around 56,500 people and is about 3,900 square kilometers in size. Only a few countries, like Russia and Venezuela, recognize it as an independent nation. Most countries, including Georgia, consider it part of Georgia's territory.\n\nSouth Ossetia was once an autonomous district within Georgia but declared independence in 1990, leading to conflicts and wars. Today, it is largely controlled by Russian military and depends on Russia for support. Some people in South Ossetia want to join Russia officially, which would end its independent status.",
