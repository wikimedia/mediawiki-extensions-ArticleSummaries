	"summary": "The Pixies are an American alternative rock band from Boston, formed in 1986. The original members are Black Francis (vocals, guitar), Joey Santiago (guitar), Kim Deal (bass, vocals), and David Lovering (drums). Their unique sound, with sudden loud-quiet shifts, influenced big names like Nirvana and Radiohead.\n\nThough they were more popular in Europe than the US, the Pixies' fame grew after they reunited in 2004, following their breakup. They've since had a few lineup changes, with Paz Lenchantin joining in 2016 and leaving in 2024, and Emma Richardson joining. They continue to make music, with their ninth album coming out in October 2024.",
