	"summary": "## Summary\n\nA **Cartesian coordinate system** uses pairs of numbers (called coordinates) to mark points on a flat surface (a plane) or in space.\n\nImagine two perpendicular lines, called axes, intersecting at a point called the **origin**. Each point on the plane has unique coordinates telling how far it is from the origin along each axis.\n\nThis system, named after Ren√© Descartes, lets us describe shapes like circles using equations. It's crucial in many fields, like math, physics, and computer graphics.",
