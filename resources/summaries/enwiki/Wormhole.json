	"summary": "A wormhole is a theoretical passage in spacetime that could connect two distant points. It's like a shortcut through space and time, joining different locations or even different times. Scientists describe it as a tunnel with two ends. Although wormholes are allowed by the laws of physics, we're not sure if they really exist. Some think they might be like a 2D shape trying to understand a 3D object. Wormholes could potentially link very far or very near distances, or even different times and universes.",
