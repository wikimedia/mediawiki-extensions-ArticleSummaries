	"summary": "The Pharisees were a Jewish group during the time of the Second Temple. They had strong beliefs and traditions that later became the basis for Rabbinic Judaism. Pharisees and Sadducees often clashed, mainly over religious interpretations and cultural differences. The Pharisees opposed Hellenization and focused on following the Mosaic Laws. They believed in the Oral Torah and the resurrection of the dead, unlike the Sadducees.\n\nThe New Testament mentions Pharisees often, sometimes in conflict with Jesus. However, some Pharisees, like Nicodemus and Paul, became followers of Jesus. Josephus, a historian, estimated there were 6,000 Pharisees before the Temple's destruction.",
