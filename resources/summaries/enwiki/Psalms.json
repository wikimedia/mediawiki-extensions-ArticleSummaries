	"summary": "The Book of Psalms is a collection of 150 religious songs or poems in the Bible. It's divided into five parts, with each part ending in a special kind of song called a doxology. These songs are about praising God, expressing sadness, asking for help, or giving thanks. While some people believe King David wrote many of them, most Bible experts think they were written by different people over several centuries, from around 900 to 500 BC. The title \"Psalms\" comes from a Greek word meaning \"instrumental music.\"",
