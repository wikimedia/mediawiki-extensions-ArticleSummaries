	"summary": "Oxytocin is a natural body chemical that acts as a hormone and brain signal. It's like a superpower that helps us feel love, bond with others, and even have babies. During special times like giving birth or when a mom breastfeeds, oxytocin tells the body to make powerful contractions to help the baby come out or the milk flow. It's also used as a medicine to help start labor or make it stronger. Our bodies make it in a special part of the brain called the hypothalamus and release it into the blood when needed.",
