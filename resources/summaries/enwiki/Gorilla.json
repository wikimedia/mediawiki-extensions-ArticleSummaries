	"summary": "Gorillas are large, plant-eating apes living in tropical African forests. They're our closest relatives after chimpanzees, sharing 95-99% of our DNA. Gorillas live in groups led by a \"silverback\" and can reach up to 1.8 meters tall and weigh up to 270 kg. There are two species: eastern and western, with several subspecies. Their habitats range from high-altitude mountains to lowland swamps. Sadly, both species are critically endangered due to poaching, habitat loss, and disease, with only around 316,000 western and 5,000 eastern gorillas left in the wild.",
