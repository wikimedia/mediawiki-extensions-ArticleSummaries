	"summary": "The okapi is a unique mammal found in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It looks like a cross between a giraffe and a zebra but is most closely related to giraffes. These animals have a tall, flexible neck, large ears, and reddish-brown fur with white stripes on their legs. Okapis live alone in forests, eating plants, and are active during the day. Females give birth to one calf after a long pregnancy. Unfortunately, okapis are endangered due to habitat loss and hunting. Efforts are being made to protect them.",
