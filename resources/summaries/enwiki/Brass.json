	"summary": "Brass, an alloy of copper and zinc, has been used since prehistoric times. It has a bright, gold-like appearance and is known for its workability and durability. Brass is often used for decorations, like drawer pulls and doorknobs, and in musical instruments. It's also great for electrical parts because it conducts electricity well. However, it's not as hard as bronze, so it's not ideal for tools or weapons. In marine environments, brass can corrode, so special brass with added tin or bronze is used instead.",
