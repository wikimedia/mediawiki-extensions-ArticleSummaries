	"summary": "A tesseract, the 4D version of a cube, is like a cube that can move in an extra direction. Four-dimensional space (4D) is an extension of the 3D space we know, where objects have length, width, and height. In 4D, there's an additional dimension, often called \"w.\" This extra dimension allows for complex shapes and movements that we can't easily imagine. The tesseract, when projected into 2D for us to see, looks like a cube within a cube, connected by lines. This helps us understand the idea of a fourth dimension, which is crucial in modern math and physics, like Einstein's theory of relativity.",
