	"summary": "Huguenots were French Protestants who followed Calvinist beliefs. The name might come from a Swiss leader, Besan√ßon Hugues. In the 1500s, they made up about 10% of France's population. After facing persecution, especially under King Louis XIV, many fled France. By the 1700s, Calvinism was rare in France.\n\nThe Huguenots' struggle led to the French Wars of Religion (1562-1598) and later rebellions. The Edict of Nantes (1598) gave them some rights, but these were later taken away. The Edict of Versailles (1787) finally ended the persecution of Protestants in France.",
