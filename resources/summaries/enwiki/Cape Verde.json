The islands were important in the slave trade, making Cape Verde wealthy. After the slave trade ended, the economy struggled, but it has since improved with tourism and foreign investment.\n\nThe country has a stable democracy and is one of Africa's most developed nations. Portuguese is the official language, but most people speak Cape Verdean Creole. The population is mostly of African descent and is primarily Roman Catholic.",
