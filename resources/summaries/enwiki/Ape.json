	"summary": "Apes, like gibbons and great apes, are smart tree-climbing primates. They live in Africa and Southeast Asia and eat mostly plants, unlike humans who have varied diets. Apes don't have tails because of a specific gene mutation. There are two main types: lesser apes (gibbons) and great apes (like gorillas and orangutans). Sadly, many apes are in danger of disappearing because their homes are being destroyed, and some are hunted. African great apes also face a risk from the Ebola virus.",
