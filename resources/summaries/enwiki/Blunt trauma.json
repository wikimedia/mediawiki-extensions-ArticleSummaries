	"summary": "Blunt trauma is an injury caused by a strong force or impact, but without anything breaking the skin. It's different from a penetrating injury, where an object goes through the skin. Common causes include car crashes, fights, sports, and falls, especially in older people.\n\nThis type of trauma can result in bruises, concussions, cuts, broken bones, and internal bleeding. The seriousness of the injury depends on how hard the impact was, where it happened on the body, and the person's overall health. Blunt trauma to the head or severe bleeding can be life-threatening and needs urgent medical help.",
