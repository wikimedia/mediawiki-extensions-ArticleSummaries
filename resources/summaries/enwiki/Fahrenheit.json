	"summary": "The Fahrenheit scale is a way to measure temperature suggested by Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit in 1724. He set 0°F as the freezing point of a special salt and water mixture, and 96°F as the average body temperature. Later, the scale was adjusted to have a 180°F difference between the freezing point of water (32°F) and its boiling point (212°F).\n\nToday, Fahrenheit is mainly used in the United States and a few other countries that follow US measurements. Most other countries use the Celsius scale, which was invented later.",
