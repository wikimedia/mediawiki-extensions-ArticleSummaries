	"summary": "Achelousaurus was a large, plant-eating dinosaur that lived about 74 million years ago in what is now North America. Its name means \"Achelous lizard,\" inspired by a Greek deity. This dinosaur belonged to a group called ceratopsids, known for their distinctive horns and frills. Achelousaurus had a large head, a hooked beak, and a bony frill with long spikes. Instead of horns, it had rough bumps on its head, likely covered in keratin.\n\nScientists believe it was related to Einiosaurus and Pachyrhinosaurus, evolving over time. Fossils show it walked on four legs and was around 20 feet long, weighing about 3 tons.",
