	"summary": "Epigenetics is the study of traits passed down without changing the DNA code. It's like extra instructions on top of the genetic ones. These changes affect how genes work, often due to environmental factors. For example, during development, cells change their function by turning some genes on and others off. This can lead to different cell types like skin, muscle, or brain cells. Epigenetic changes can even last for generations, even though the DNA stays the same. Key players in this process include DNA methylation and special proteins called histones.",
