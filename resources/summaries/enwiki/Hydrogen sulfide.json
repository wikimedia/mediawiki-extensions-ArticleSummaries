	"summary": "Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a dangerous gas with a strong, unpleasant smell. It is found in nature, like in swamps and volcanoes, and is produced by some bacteria. This gas is harmful to most living things because it stops cells from getting oxygen. Even small amounts can be poisonous, causing breathing problems and even death. Despite its dangers, our bodies use tiny amounts of it as a signal. Swedish scientist Carl Wilhelm Scheele first discovered it in 1777.",
