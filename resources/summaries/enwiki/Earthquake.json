	"summary": "Earthquakes happen when there's a sudden release of energy deep inside the Earth, causing the ground to shake. They mostly occur along tectonic plate boundaries, especially around the Pacific Ocean. This energy release creates waves, and the point where it starts is called the hypocenter. The place on the ground directly above it is the epicenter. Earthquakes can be tiny and unnoticeable or incredibly powerful, causing widespread destruction. They can happen due to faults in the Earth's crust, volcanic activity, or even human activities like mining. Scientists study earthquakes to predict and prepare for them, designing buildings to withstand the shaking.",
