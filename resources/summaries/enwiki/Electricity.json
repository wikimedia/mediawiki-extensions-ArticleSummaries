	"summary": "Electricity is the movement of tiny charged particles called electrons. It's related to magnetism and can create dramatic effects like lightning. When electrons move, they create an electric current, which can produce light (like in a lamp) or power devices. This electricity is what makes our modern world tick, from charging our phones to running trains. People have known about electricity for a long time, but it wasn't until the 1800s that we figured out how to use it in our daily lives, leading to big changes in how we live and work.",
