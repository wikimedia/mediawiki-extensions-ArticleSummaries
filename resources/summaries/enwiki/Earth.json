	"summary": "Earth is a unique planet in our solar system as it is the only known place with life. It's an ocean world, with water covering most of its surface. The planet has landmasses, mountains, and active volcanoes. Earth's atmosphere, made mostly of nitrogen and oxygen, protects us from harmful space rays and meteoroids. It also keeps the planet warm enough for liquid water, which is essential for life. Earth orbits the Sun and takes about a year to complete one trip. It also has a natural satellite, the Moon, which affects our tides.",
