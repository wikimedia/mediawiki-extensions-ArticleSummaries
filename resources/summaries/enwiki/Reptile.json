	"summary": "Reptiles are a diverse group of animals with \"cold-blooded\" metabolism and over 12,000 species. They include turtles, crocodiles, lizards, and snakes. Reptiles evolved from ancient tetrapods during the Carboniferous period. The two main reptile groups, Archosauromorpha and Lepidosauromorpha, split during the Permian. Some reptiles, like snakes, lost their limbs over time. Unlike amphibians, they don't have a watery baby stage. Most lay eggs, but some, like certain lizards, give birth to live young. Reptiles live almost everywhere except Antarctica, ranging from tiny geckos to massive crocodiles.",
