	"summary": "Archaea are a group of single-celled organisms, initially thought to be bacteria but later found to be distinct. They live in various places, from hot springs to our gut. Archaea are important for Earth's ecosystems, helping with tasks like breaking down materials and producing methane. These microbes are unique; they have different genes and can survive in extreme conditions. While they are often helpful, living alongside other organisms, no known archaea cause diseases. Their special abilities make them interesting for scientific study and practical uses, like creating biogas.",
