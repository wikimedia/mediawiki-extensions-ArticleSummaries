	"summary": "An internal combustion engine (ICE) is a type of engine where fuel and air burn inside a chamber to create energy. This energy moves parts like pistons or turbine blades, changing chemical energy into motion. The first successful ICE was made around 1860, and they're used in most cars, planes, and boats today. ICEs can run on different fuels, including gasoline, diesel, and even renewable ones like biodiesel and ethanol. Some ICEs, like jet engines, use continuous combustion, while most cars use intermittent combustion, like four-stroke engines.",
