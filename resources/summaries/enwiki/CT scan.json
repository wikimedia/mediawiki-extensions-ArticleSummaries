	"summary": "A CT scan is a special kind of X-ray that gives doctors detailed pictures of the inside of your body. It uses a machine that rotates around you, taking lots of pictures from different angles. These pictures are then put together by a computer to show \"slices\" of your body. CT scans help doctors see if there are any problems, like broken bones or sick tissues. They can even be used for things that aren't alive, like checking the inside of machines. The people who do these scans are called radiographers. This technology was invented in the 1970s and won a Nobel Prize in 1979.",
