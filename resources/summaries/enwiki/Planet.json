	"summary": "Our Solar System has eight planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Planets are large objects that orbit stars. The word 'planet' comes from ancient Greek, meaning 'wanderer,' as they move across the sky.\n\nPlanets come in different types: terrestrial (rocky) and giant (gaseous). Over time, our understanding of planets has grown, leading to the discovery of exoplanets (planets outside our Solar System) with unique characteristics. The definition of a planet has been debated, especially with the finding of dwarf planets like Pluto.",
