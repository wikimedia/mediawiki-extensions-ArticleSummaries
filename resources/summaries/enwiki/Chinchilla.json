	"summary": "Chinchillas are two species of rodents native to the Andes mountains in South America. They live in groups called \"herds\" at high elevations. Historically, they ranged across Bolivia, Peru, and Chile, but now are only found in Chile. With around 20,000 hairs per square centimeter, they have the densest fur of any land mammal. Named after the Chincha people, who used their fur and ate their meat, chinchillas were hunted to near extinction for their soft fur. Today, most chinchillas used in the fur industry are farm-raised. Domestic chinchillas can also be kept as pets.",
