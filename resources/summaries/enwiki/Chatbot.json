Chatbots have been around since the 1960s, but they've become really popular recently. You might have seen ChatGPT or similar ones. These chatbots learn from large language models and can talk about many topics.\n\nThey are often used to help customers and answer questions. However, sometimes they might give wrong information, which is called 'hallucination'. This can lead to spreading false content, known as 'botshit'. Despite this, chatbots are useful and are being used more and more.",
