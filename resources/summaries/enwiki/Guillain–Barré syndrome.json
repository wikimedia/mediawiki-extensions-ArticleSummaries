	"summary": "Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) is a rare, serious condition where your body's immune system attacks the nerves, causing muscle weakness. It often starts in the feet and hands and can quickly spread to other parts of the body. Some people may have trouble breathing and need a machine to help. The cause is unknown, but it might be linked to infections or vaccinations. Doctors diagnose it by ruling out other conditions and doing tests on nerves and spinal fluid. Most people recover with treatment, but it can take time, and some may have long-term weakness.",
