	"summary": "The Bill of Rights is the first ten amendments to the U.S. Constitution, added to protect personal freedoms and limit government power. They were written in 1789 by James Madison to address concerns raised during the Constitution's ratification. The amendments guarantee rights like freedom of speech, religion, and the right to a fair trial. They also state that powers not given to the federal government belong to the states or people. Most were ratified in 1791, with one amendment added later in 1992. Originally only applying to the federal government, the Bill of Rights now also applies to state governments through the Fourteenth Amendment.",
