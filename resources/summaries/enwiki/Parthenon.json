	"summary": "The Parthenon is an ancient Greek temple on a hill in Athens. It was built to honor the goddess Athena after the Greeks won a war against the Persians. Construction started in 447 BC and took about 10 years. The Parthenon was not just a temple but also a place to store the city's treasure. Later, it became a Christian church and then a mosque. In the 1600s, a bomb damaged it, and some of its sculptures were taken away, which caused controversy. Today, people are working to fix and protect this important symbol of ancient Greece.",
