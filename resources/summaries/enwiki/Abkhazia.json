	"summary": "Abkhazia is a small country located between Eastern Europe and West Asia, by the Black Sea. It has been in conflict with its neighbor, Georgia, for many years. This is because Abkhazia wants to be an independent country, but Georgia claims it as its own territory. Only a few countries, like Russia and Venezuela, recognize Abkhazia as a separate nation. The United Nations and most countries side with Georgia. The disagreement led to a war in the 1990s and another one in 2008, causing many Georgians to leave Abkhazia. The situation remains tense, and Abkhazia is often considered a Russian-controlled area.",
