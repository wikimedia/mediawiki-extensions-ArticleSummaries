	"summary": "The Union Jack is the national flag of the United Kingdom, combining the crosses of St. George (England), St. Andrew (Scotland), and St. Patrick (Ireland). It's also used in some former British colonies. The design dates back to 1606, when King James I united England and Scotland. The current version was created in 1801 after Ireland joined. Despite Wales' absence on the flag, it's represented in the UK's royal coat of arms. Many countries and territories still use the Union Jack in their flags, showing historical British connections.",
