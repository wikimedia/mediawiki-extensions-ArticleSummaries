	"summary": "Mont-Saint-Michel is a small island off the coast of Normandy, France, known for its stunning abbey. It's a special place because at low tide, you can walk to it from the mainland, but at high tide, it becomes an island again, protecting it from enemies. People have lived and worshiped here for centuries, and it's now a popular tourist spot, listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The island has a rich history, even serving as a prison at one time. Today, it attracts millions of visitors, who can explore its ancient buildings and enjoy its unique location.",
