	"summary": "Viruses are tiny germs that can infect living things, from plants to animals and even bacteria. They are so small that we need special microscopes to see them. Viruses can make copies of themselves inside our cells, and they can spread in many ways, like through the air when we cough or sneeze, or by touching something that has the virus on it. Some viruses cause diseases like the flu or chickenpox, but our bodies can fight them with the help of vaccines. Scientists study viruses to understand how they work and to find ways to stop them from making us sick.",
