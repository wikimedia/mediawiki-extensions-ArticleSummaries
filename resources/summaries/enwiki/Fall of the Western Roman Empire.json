	"summary": "The fall of the Western Roman Empire happened when it couldn't control its provinces anymore. This was due to weak armies, economic problems, and attacks from groups like the Goths and Huns. After years of fighting and political chaos, the last Western Roman Emperor was removed in 476 AD. The Eastern Roman Empire, also known as the Byzantine Empire, continued on, but the Western Empire never recovered. This event marks a major turning point in history, leading to the Middle Ages.",
