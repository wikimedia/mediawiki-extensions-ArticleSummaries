	"summary": "Dragonflies are flying insects with about 3,000 known species worldwide, mostly living in tropical areas. They have big, complex eyes, clear wings, and long bodies. Many have bright, iridescent colors. Dragonflies are strong, agile fliers, unlike the weaker-flying damselflies. They are predators, eating other insects, and their nymphs live in water. Dragonflies have a complex mating process, and fossils show that giant dragonfly-like insects existed millions of years ago. In culture, dragonflies symbolize different things, from courage in Japan to being sinister in European folklore.",
