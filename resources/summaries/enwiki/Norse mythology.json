The universe in these stories has nine worlds connected by a big tree named Yggdrasil.\n\nThe myths also talk about the creation of the world from a giant named Ymir and the first humans, Ask and Embla. They predict a big battle, Ragnarök, after which the world will start again, with new gods and people. People have been studying these myths since the 17th century, and they've influenced modern movies, books, and even religion.",
