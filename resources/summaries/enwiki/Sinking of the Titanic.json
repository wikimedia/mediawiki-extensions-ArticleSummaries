	"summary": "The RMS *Titanic* sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on April 15, 1912, after hitting an iceberg. It was the largest ship of its time and was only four days into its first journey. Over 1,500 people died, making it a terrible disaster. The ship received ice warnings but was going too fast. It hit an iceberg, and water filled six of its compartments. There weren't enough lifeboats for everyone, and many were launched only partly full. The disaster led to new safety rules for ships.",
