	"summary": "Santorini is a beautiful Greek island in the Aegean Sea. It's officially named Thira and is part of a small group of islands called the Cyclades. The island formed from a massive volcanic eruption thousands of years ago, creating a huge, water-filled crater called a caldera. This eruption was one of the biggest in history and covered the area in thick volcanic ash. Today, Santorini is a popular tourist destination known for its stunning views, white buildings, and blue roofs. It's part of a larger volcanic region in the Aegean Sea.",
