	"summary": "Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD) is a rare, fatal brain disorder that causes memory loss, behavior changes, and eventually, severe disability. It's caused by abnormal proteins called prions. Most cases happen for no known reason, but some are inherited. CJD can't be spread through normal contact, but it might be transmitted through exposure to infected brain or spinal tissue. There's no cure, and most people die within a year of diagnosis. It usually affects people around 60 years old.",
