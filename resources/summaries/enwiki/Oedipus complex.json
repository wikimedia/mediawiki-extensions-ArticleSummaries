	"summary": "The Oedipus complex is a theory by Sigmund Freud. It says that boys have secret feelings of love for their mothers and dislike for their fathers. This happens during a stage of childhood development. Freud thought these feelings could cause problems later in life if not dealt with. The theory is named after a Greek myth about King Oedipus, who unknowingly married his mother. Some people criticize Freud's ideas, saying they don't work for everyone and might ignore real issues like child abuse.",
