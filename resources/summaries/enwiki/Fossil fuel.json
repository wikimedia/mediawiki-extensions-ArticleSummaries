	"summary": "Fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas are made from ancient plants and animals over millions of years. We use them for energy, but they are not renewable and cause big problems for the environment. Burning these fuels creates lots of greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide, which leads to global warming and ocean acidification. It also causes air pollution, affecting people's health.\n\nBecause of these issues, many people are pushing for a change to cleaner, sustainable energy. This shift is challenging as fossil fuels are widely used and supported by powerful industries. International agreements aim to help this transition, with goals to reduce climate change impacts.",
