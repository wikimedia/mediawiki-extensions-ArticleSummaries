	"summary": "Zombies are mythical creatures, often depicted in horror stories. They are dead bodies brought back to life, usually through magic or science. The word \"zombie\" comes from Haitian folklore. In popular culture, zombies are often shown as hungry for human flesh, an idea popularized by movies like *Night of the Living Dead*. Recently, zombies have been portrayed in a different light, sometimes as friends or love interests for humans, using the zombie archetype to explore themes of discrimination and freedom.",
