	"summary": "Hajj is an important journey for Muslims, taking place in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. It's a religious duty for those who can afford it, happening once a year. Pilgrims travel to the Kaaba, a holy site, wearing special clothes and performing rituals. These include walking around the Kaaba, kissing a sacred stone, and walking between two hills. The Hajj traces its roots back to the prophet Muhammad and even earlier to Abraham. Usually, millions attend, but numbers changed due to COVID-19 restrictions.",
