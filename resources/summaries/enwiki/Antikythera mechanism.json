	"summary": "The Antikythera mechanism is an ancient Greek device, like a tiny computer, found in a shipwreck. It's over 2,000 years old and shows how smart the ancients were. This mechanism could predict the movements of the Sun, Moon, and stars, even showing when eclipses would happen. It was used to track time and important events like the Olympic Games. Scientists still study it to understand how it works and what it tells us about ancient technology.",
