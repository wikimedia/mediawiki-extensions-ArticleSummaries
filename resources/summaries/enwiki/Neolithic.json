	"summary": "The Neolithic Age, or New Stone Age, was a time of big changes for early people. It started around 12,000 years ago and lasted until about 2,000 BC in some places. During this time, people learned to farm, keep animals, and settle in one place instead of hunting and moving around. This is called the Neolithic Revolution.\n\nIt began in the Middle East and spread to other parts of the world. The invention of farming and animal domestication was a big deal, as it changed how people lived and ate. This period is an important part of history, showing how ancient communities developed and grew.",
