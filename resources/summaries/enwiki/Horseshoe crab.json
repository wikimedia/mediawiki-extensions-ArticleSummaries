	"summary": "Horseshoe crabs are ancient arthropods, often called \"living fossils,\" that are more related to spiders than true crabs. Their body has three main parts, with the large cephalothorax containing most of their eyes, limbs, and organs. There are only four living species, found in coastal North America and South Asia. They primarily live on the ocean floor but can swim. Horseshoe crabs are important for their blood, used to detect bacteria, and are also used as fishing bait and food. Overharvesting and habitat loss have led to population declines, so many areas now protect them and have breeding programs.",
