	"summary": "The pineapple is a tropical fruit that originated in South America. It's a special type of plant called a bromeliad. When Europeans discovered it in the 17th century, it became a symbol of wealth. Pineapples grow on small shrubs, and each fruit is actually made up of many flowers that fuse together. They usually take about a year to mature and can be grown in greenhouses or tropical plantations.",
