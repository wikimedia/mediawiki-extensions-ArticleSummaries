	"summary": "The Rosary is a set of Catholic prayers, often said using a string of beads. It's divided into groups of ten prayers, called decades. Each decade starts with \"Our Father\" and usually ends with \"Glory Be\" and sometimes the \"O my Jesus\" prayer. These prayers help people meditate on important events in the lives of Jesus and Mary, known as the Mysteries of the Rosary. There are 20 mysteries in total, divided into four groups for different days of the week. Pope Pius V first set these mysteries, and Pope John Paul II later added the Luminous Mysteries.",
