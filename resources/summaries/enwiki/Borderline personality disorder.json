	"summary": "BPD is a mental health condition that affects how people think and feel about themselves and others. It often starts in early adulthood and can cause mood swings, self-harm, and trouble in relationships. People with BPD may struggle to control their emotions and might feel empty or afraid of being abandoned. It's linked to genes, past trauma, and brain parts that control emotions.\n\nTreatment includes therapy, like CBT or DBT, to help manage symptoms. Medication might help with related issues, but it doesn't cure BPD. About 1 in 60 people have BPD, and it's more common in women. With the right help, many people with BPD can improve over time.",
