	"summary": "The Baháʼí Faith is a religion started in the 1800s that believes all religions are important and people should be united. It was founded by Baháʼu'lláh and has faced trouble in the Middle East. There are millions of followers, called Baháʼís, all over the world.\n\nThe religion looks up to three main figures: the Báb, Baháʼu'lláh, and his son, ʻAbdu'l-Bahá. They believe God reveals religion through special people, like Jesus and Muhammad. Baháʼís want to bring people together, ending racism, sexism, and nationalism. They aim for a peaceful world where everyone prospers.\n\nBaháʼí writings, like the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, are important texts that teach these beliefs.",
