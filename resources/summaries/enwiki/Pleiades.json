	"summary": "The Pleiades, also known as the Seven Sisters, is a bright star cluster in the constellation Taurus. It's one of the nearest star clusters to Earth and looks like a small dipper. The cluster is made up of young, hot, blue stars that formed around 100 million years ago. These stars are currently passing through a dust cloud, creating reflection nebulae around them. The Pleiades will likely stay together for another 250 million years before being pulled apart by gravity.",
