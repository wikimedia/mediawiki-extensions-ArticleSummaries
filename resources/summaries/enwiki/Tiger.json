	"summary": "Tigers are the biggest cat species found in Asia. They have strong bodies, big heads, and orange fur with black stripes. These powerful predators live in forests and hunt animals like deer. Tigers usually live alone and mark their territory. Female tigers give birth to 2-3 cubs, which stay with their mom for about two years.\n\nUnfortunately, tigers are in danger. They have lost most of their natural habitat and are often hunted illegally. This has led to a big drop in their population. To help tigers, countries are working on conservation plans and trying to stop poaching. Tigers are loved worldwide and are known for their importance in many cultures.",
