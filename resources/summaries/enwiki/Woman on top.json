The most common one is the \"cowgirl\" position, where the woman sits on top of the man facing him. She can control the rhythm and depth of penetration, which many women enjoy. This position also makes clitoral stimulation easier.\n\nOther positions include the 69 and pompoir. In all these positions, the woman can also stimulate the man's scrotum. She might take control if she hasn't reached orgasm yet, even using fingers to help her achieve it.",
