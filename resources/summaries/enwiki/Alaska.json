It's not connected to the rest of the U.S., with Canada to its east and Russia to its west across the Bering Strait. Alaska has a small population but is rich in natural resources like oil and gas, making it one of the wealthiest states per person. It was first colonized by Russia but became a U.S. territory in 1867 and a state in 1959. Its capital is Juneau, and the most populous city is Anchorage.",
