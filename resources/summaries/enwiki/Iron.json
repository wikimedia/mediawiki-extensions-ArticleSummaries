	"summary": "Iron is a common metal element, symbolized as Fe, and is the fourth most abundant in Earth's crust. It's mainly found in the core of the Earth and was historically important in the transition from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age. Iron is cheap and widely used in industries, especially in alloys like steel. \n\nIt easily rusts when exposed to oxygen and water, forming a brown-to-black substance called rust. Iron is crucial for living organisms, particularly in blood proteins like hemoglobin, which carries oxygen in our bodies.",
