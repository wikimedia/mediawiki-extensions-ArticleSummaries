	"summary": "A monarchy is a type of government where a king, queen, or other leader, called a monarch, rules. This person usually holds power for life or until they choose to step down. Monarchs often inherit their role, meaning it passes down within a family. They might have full control over the country (absolute monarchy) or only symbolic power (constitutional monarchy).\n\nIn the past, many countries had monarchs, but today, only a few do. Most modern monarchies are constitutional, meaning the monarch has limited power and mostly performs ceremonial duties.",
