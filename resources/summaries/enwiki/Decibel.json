	"summary": "A decibel (dB) is a unit of measurement used to compare two amounts of power or strength. It's like a score that tells you how much bigger or smaller one thing is compared to another. For example, if two signals have a 1 dB difference, the stronger one is about 25% more powerful. Decibels are used in many areas, like sound measurement (how loud something is) and electronics (like how strong a signal is). It helps scientists and engineers talk about changes in a simple way.",
