	"summary": "The Gaza Strip is a small Palestinian territory on the Mediterranean Sea. It is very crowded, with over 2 million people living there, mostly Palestinian refugees. Gaza is bordered by Egypt and Israel, who have controlled it at different times. Israel occupied Gaza after the 1967 war and still controls much of its borders and resources. \n\nGaza has faced a blockade since 2007, making it hard for people and goods to enter or leave. This has caused many problems for the residents, including high unemployment and not enough resources. Despite challenges, Gaza is an important place for Palestinian culture and resistance.",
