	"summary": "## The Appalachian Mountains\n\nThe Appalachian Mountains, or Appalachians, are an old mountain range in eastern North America, running from Canada to Alabama. They are not as high as the Rocky Mountains, with the tallest peak, Mount Mitchell, reaching 6,684 feet.\n\nThese mountains formed over 1 billion years ago when continents collided, creating folded and faulted rocks. They've been shaped by erosion for millions of years.\n\nThe Appalachians were important during America's expansion, making east-west travel difficult. Today, they're known for the Appalachian Trail, a 2,175-mile hiking path.",
