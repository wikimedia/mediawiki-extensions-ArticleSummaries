	"summary": "Glycerol is a sweet, non-toxic liquid often used in food and medicine. It has a unique structure called a triol, meaning it has three hydroxyl groups. These groups make glycerol mix easily with water and attract moisture, which is why it's called hygroscopic. You might know it as a sweetener in food or a humectant (a substance that keeps things moist) in medicines. It's also a key part of many fats and oils in our bodies and in nature.",
