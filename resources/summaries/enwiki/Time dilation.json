	"summary": "Time dilation is when two clocks show different times because they're moving at different speeds or are in different gravitational fields. If one clock is moving, it will seem to tick slower than a stationary clock when observed. This is due to special and general relativity. It's also been proven in experiments and is important in things like GPS.",
