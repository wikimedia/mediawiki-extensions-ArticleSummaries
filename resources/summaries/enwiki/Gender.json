	"summary": "Gender is about how people act, feel, and are seen as male, female, or non-binary. It's different from sex, which is about biology. In the past, \"gender\" mostly meant grammar, but in the 1970s, feminists started using it to talk about social roles too. Now, many scientists and organizations use \"gender\" to describe how people express themselves, not just their bodies. This can include cultural ideas and behaviors. Some places even have more than two gender categories.",
