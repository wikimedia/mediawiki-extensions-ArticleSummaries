	"summary": "Dialectic is a way of thinking and discussing ideas, originally a conversation between people with different opinions. It aims to find the truth by using logical arguments, similar to a debate but without emotional influences. This idea started in ancient times and was later changed by a philosopher named Hegel. He used the term to describe how ideas develop by solving their own contradictions. Marx and Engels also used this concept in their theory of history. Some modern philosophers think this method is not scientific.",
