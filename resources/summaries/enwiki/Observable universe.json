	"summary": "The observable universe is the part of the universe we can see from Earth. It's like a giant sphere centered on our planet, filled with galaxies, stars, and other matter. Light from these objects takes time to reach us, so we see them as they were in the past. Scientists think there are hundreds of billions of galaxies out there. The edge of this observable universe is about 46.5 billion light-years away. Beyond this, there's a limit to what we can know because nothing can travel faster than light. As the universe expands, some distant objects will eventually fade from view.",
