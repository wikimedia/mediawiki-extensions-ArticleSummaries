	"summary": "Montserrat is a small island in the Caribbean Sea, known as the \"Emerald Isle\" due to its Irish connections. It is a British territory and a member of the Caribbean Community. In the 1990s, a volcano erupted, destroying the capital city, Plymouth. This forced many people to leave, and the population decreased significantly. The island is still recovering, with a new town and port being built. Despite the challenges, Montserrat remains a unique and beautiful place.",
