	"summary": "A car, or automobile, is a wheeled vehicle that mostly runs on roads. With around one billion cars globally, they are vital to modern economies. The first car was invented in 1769, but it wasn't until 1886 that Carl Benz created the first practical, modern car. Cars became popular in the 20th century, especially in the US. They are now essential for transportation, offering convenience and independence.\n\nCars have many features like air conditioning and navigation systems. Most use fossil fuels, but electric cars are becoming popular and may be cheaper to buy than gas-powered cars by 2025. While cars provide benefits like mobility, they also have costs, including environmental impact and road congestion.",
