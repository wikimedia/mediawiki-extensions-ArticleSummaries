	"summary": "The Flag of Italy, called the Tricolour, has three equal vertical stripes: green, white, and red. The green is closest to the pole. It's officially recognized in the Italian Constitution. The flag is celebrated every year on January 7th, called Tricolour Day, marking the first time an Italian state adopted it in 1797. The colors first appeared in Genoa in 1789 and were used in war flags soon after. The tricolour became the national flag when Italy united in 1861 and remains a strong symbol of Italian identity.",
