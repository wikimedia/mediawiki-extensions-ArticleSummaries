He's the son of a giant and a goddess, and has many children, including the wolf Fenrir and the world serpent Jörmungandr. Loki can turn into different animals and even an old woman. He accidentally causes the death of the god Baldr, leading to his punishment: being bound with his son's intestines, where he suffers from dripping venom. Loki is predicted to break free during Ragnarök, battling the gods. He's often seen as a trickster, and his stories are found in ancient texts and even in modern pop culture.",
