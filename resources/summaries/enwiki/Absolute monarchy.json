	"summary": "Absolute monarchy is when a king or queen has all the power and no one can tell them what to do. This was popular in Europe a long time ago, especially during the 1600s. Kings like Louis XIV in France had absolute power. In England, King Charles I tried to rule this way, but it led to a big war.\n\nOver time, people started to want governments where the power comes from the people. Now, only a few places still have absolute monarchies, like Brunei and Saudi Arabia. Most countries have constitutional monarchies, where the king or queen has less power and works with others to rule.",
