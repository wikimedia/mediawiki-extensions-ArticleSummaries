Located on the River Lagan, it was once a major center for linen and shipbuilding, attracting people from various backgrounds. The city's growth led to sectarian tensions, resulting in periods of conflict, especially during the early 20th century.\n\nAfter the Belfast Agreement in 1998, the city's politics shifted, with increased support for Irish nationalists. Today, Belfast is experiencing economic growth in sectors like technology, tourism, and film. It has two universities and is known for its music scene, earning a UNESCO City of Music designation in 2021.",
