	"summary": "A sphinx is a mythical creature with a human head, a lion's body, and sometimes eagle wings. In Greek myths, it's a scary monster that asks riddles and eats people if they can't solve them. Oedipus' story involves such a sphinx. In Egypt, sphinxes are usually shown as men, called androsphinxes, and are strong, kind guardians often found at temple entrances. During the Renaissance, sphinxes became popular in art again, but their appearance changed as they were adopted into different cultures.",
