This Austronesian language is spoken in Metro Manila and other urban areas. The 1987 Constitution aims to enhance Filipino by incorporating other Philippine languages.\n\nFilipino grammar is flexible, allowing for different word orders (verb-subject-object or subject-verb-object). It has a unique morphosyntactic alignment and is agglutinative, meaning words are formed by combining morphemes. The language isn't tonal, but it does have pitch accents.",
