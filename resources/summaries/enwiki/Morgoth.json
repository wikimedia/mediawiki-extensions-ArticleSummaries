	"summary": "Morgoth Bauglir, originally named Melkor, is a powerful being in J.R.R. Tolkien's stories, like a god. He starts off good but turns evil, becoming the main bad guy in Middle-earth. All the bad things happening are his fault. He's like a Satan figure, once great but now proud and rebellious. Some think he's based on the Norse god Odin, with bad traits like destructiveness and deceit. Even a powerful good wizard, Gandalf, has some of Odin's good traits.",
