	"summary": "Colonialism is when one country takes control of another land and its people to benefit itself. This often involves treating the local people unfairly and taking their resources. Colonizers believe they are superior and have the right to rule. This started with European countries in the 15th century and spread worldwide. It had a big impact on many places, and some countries were colonized for hundreds of years. Many colonies later gained independence, but the effects of colonialism can still be seen today in different parts of the world.",
