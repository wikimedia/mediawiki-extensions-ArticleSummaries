The Chrysler Pacifica is a popular example, being the top-selling minivan in the U.S. in 2020.\n\nMinivans evolved from various vehicle styles in the 1980s, with Chrysler and Renault leading the way. They became very popular in the 1990s but have since been overshadowed by SUVs in some markets while remaining sought-after luxury vehicles in others.",
