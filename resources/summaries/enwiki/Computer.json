	"summary": "A computer is a machine that performs calculations and follows instructions, called programs. Modern computers, like the ones we use daily, are digital electronic devices. They can do various tasks, from simple calculations to running complex software.\n\nEarly computers were just for math, but they've evolved a lot. They started as simple tools like the abacus and later became mechanical and electrical machines. During World War II, the first digital computers were made. Over time, computers got faster, smaller, and more powerful, leading to the digital world we have today.\n\nComputers now are made of parts like the CPU (brain of the computer), memory, and devices to input and output information.",
