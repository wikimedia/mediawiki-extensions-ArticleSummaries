It is often added to steel to make stainless steel, which is widely used in cooking and building. Chromium can also be polished to a high shine and doesn't tarnish easily. It gets its name from the Greek word for color, as many chromium compounds are very colorful. However, some forms of chromium, like chromate, are poisonous and can cause cancer.",
