	"summary": "The Venus flytrap is a unique plant that eats bugs. Native to North and South Carolina, it has \"jaws\" that snap shut when insects touch special hairs inside. These hairs make sure the trap only closes on live prey, saving energy. The plant is related to sundews and can sense heat, helping it survive fires. Though popular as a pet, Venus flytraps are becoming rare in the wild and may need protection.",
