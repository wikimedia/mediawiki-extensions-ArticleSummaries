	"summary": "In 1961, psychologist Stanley Milgram did a famous experiment. He asked people to give what they thought were real electric shocks to others for wrong answers. But the shocks were fake, and the others were actors. Milgram wanted to see if people would follow orders even if it went against their conscience. Surprisingly, many people followed the instructions all the way to the highest shock level. This made people think about how some Nazi war criminals might have just been following orders during the Holocaust. However, not everyone agrees with this interpretation.",
