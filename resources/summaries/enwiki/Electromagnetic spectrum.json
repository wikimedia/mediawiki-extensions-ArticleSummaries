	"summary": "The electromagnetic spectrum is like a big family of different types of light and waves, organized by their frequency and wavelength. It includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. Each type has unique features and uses. Radio waves have the longest wavelengths and are great for communication, while gamma rays have the shortest wavelengths and are very powerful, even able to cause chemical changes in atoms. Scientists use spectroscopy to study how these waves interact with things around us.",
