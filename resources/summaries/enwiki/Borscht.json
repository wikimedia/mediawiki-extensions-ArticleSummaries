	"summary": "Borscht is a sour soup popular in Eastern Europe and Northern Asia. It's often red because of beetroots, but can also be green, white, or made with cabbage. Originally, it was made from a plant called hogweed. Now, it's usually a mix of meat stock, vegetables like cabbage and carrots, and seasonings. It can have meat or be vegetarian, served hot or cold. Many cultures claim borscht as their own, and it's often eaten with sour cream or eggs.",
