	"summary": "The Normans were a group of people who lived in medieval France. They were a mix of Norse Vikings and local French. After years of raids, a Viking leader named Rollo made peace with the French king in 911. Over time, the Normans adopted French culture and language but kept some Viking traditions. They became known for their fighting skills and conquered parts of England and Italy. The Normans had a big impact on Europe with their unique architecture and military power. Their legacy can still be seen in languages and cultures today.",
