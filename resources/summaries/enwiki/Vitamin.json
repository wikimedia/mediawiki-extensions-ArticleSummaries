	"summary": "Vitamins are like tiny helpers our bodies need to work properly. They're organic molecules found in food, and some are even made by our bodies. There are 13 main vitamins, like Vitamin C and Vitamin D, each with a special job. For instance, Vitamin A helps our cells grow, and Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant. \n\nWe used to get vitamins only from food, but now we can take supplements if we don't get enough from our diet. It's important not to take too many vitamins, as that can also cause health issues.",
