	"summary": "**Final Fantasy XVI** is a 2023 action role-playing game by Square Enix for PlayStation 5 and Windows. It features open worlds, melee and magic combat, and creatures like Chocobos and powerful Eikons. Set on the twin continents of Valisthea, the story follows Clive Rosfield as he navigates a magical drought and war between nations. Developed since 2015, the game aimed for a darker fantasy appeal. Critics liked its story, graphics, music, and gameplay but noted flaws in role-playing elements, technical issues, and side quests. It sold well but didn't meet expectations.
