It suggests that sometimes, doing bad things is okay if it helps achieve political success. Originally written in Italian instead of Latin, it was a groundbreaking work. Machiavelli uses examples from history to explain his ideas, including the violent actions of Cesare Borgia. \"The Prince\" is seen as one of the first modern political philosophy books, valuing practical results over ideals. It's so famous (or infamous) that it led to the negative meaning of \"Machiavellian\" and the bad reputation of the words \"politics\" and \"politician.\"",
