	"summary": "The Russian Empire was a huge empire that existed from 1721 to 1917, covering most of northern Eurasia. At its largest, it was the third-biggest empire in history. It started growing when nearby rival powers like Sweden and Poland got weaker. The empire was ruled by powerful leaders called tsars, who expanded their land and made Russia a major European power.\n\nPeter the Great and Catherine the Great were important rulers who modernized Russia. The empire faced challenges like wars, a big famine, and political unrest. In 1917, this led to the Russian Revolution, where the tsar was removed, and a new republic was formed.",
