	"summary": "Norovirus, often called the winter vomiting disease, is a very common cause of stomach flu. It leads to diarrhea, vomiting, and stomach pain, and sometimes fever or headaches. Symptoms start within 12 to 48 hours of exposure and usually go away in one to three days.\n\nThe virus spreads easily through contaminated food, water, or surfaces, or by touching someone who is infected. It can be hard to avoid, especially in crowded places.\n\nThere's no specific treatment, but drinking plenty of fluids is important to prevent dehydration. Handwashing and cleaning surfaces help to prevent the spread of norovirus.",
