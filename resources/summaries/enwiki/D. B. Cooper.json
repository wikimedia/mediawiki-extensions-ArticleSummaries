	"summary": "In 1971, a man named D. B. Cooper hijacked a plane and demanded a ransom. After releasing the passengers, he instructed the crew to fly to Mexico City. During the flight, Cooper parachuted out of the plane and disappeared. Only a small amount of the ransom money was ever found. The FBI investigated for years but couldn't identify Cooper or figure out what happened to him. This hijacking remains a famous unsolved mystery.\n\nThe event led to big changes in airport security, including metal detectors and bag checks. Planes were also modified to prevent in-flight parachute escapes.",
