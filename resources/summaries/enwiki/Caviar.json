	"summary": "Caviar is a special food made from the eggs, or roe, of sturgeon fish. The most valuable and rare caviar comes from the beluga sturgeon in the Caspian Sea. It is considered a luxury item and is often very expensive. Traditionally, caviar refers to wild sturgeon roe from the Caspian and Black Seas. However, the term now also includes roe from other sturgeon and fish like salmon and trout. Fresh, unpasteurized caviar is typically more prized than pasteurized caviar.",
