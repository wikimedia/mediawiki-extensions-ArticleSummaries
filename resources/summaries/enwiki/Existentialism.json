	"summary": "Existentialism is a philosophy that focuses on individuals and their experiences in a world without clear answers. It encourages people to take responsibility for their actions and live authentically. This means making choices and finding meaning in life, even when things seem absurd or scary.\n\nMany existentialist thinkers, like SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard and Jean-Paul Sartre, believed that traditional philosophy was too complicated and didn't connect with real life. They wanted to emphasize personal freedom and the importance of individual choices. This philosophy has influenced many areas, including art, literature, and psychology.",
