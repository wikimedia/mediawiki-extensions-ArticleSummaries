	"summary": "Lye is a strong chemical made from alkali metal hydroxides, usually sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or potassium hydroxide (KOH). Historically, it was made from wood ashes and rainwater, creating a caustic solution called lye water. Now, it's commercially produced using a chloralkali process. Lye is sold as flakes, pellets, or solutions and is commonly used in soapmaking. It's important to handle lye with care as it is highly corrosive.",
