	"summary": "##  Football's 500+ Goal Club\n\nTwenty-five soccer players have scored 500 or more goals during their careers, according to the IFFHS.  The first was Hungarian Imre Schlosser in 1927. Lionel Messi scored the most goals (672) for a single club, Barcelona.\n\nThere's debate about who truly holds the record due to different rules about which goals count. Some argue Pel√© scored over 1,000 goals, while others say Josef Bican did. Cristiano Ronaldo is also close to the top.  Making it hard to be sure is the lack of official records and the fact that older games, like friendly matches, aren't always counted.",
