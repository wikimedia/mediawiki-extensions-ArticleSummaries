	"summary": "Finnish is a language spoken mainly in Finland and by Finns living abroad. It's one of two official languages in Finland, along with Swedish. Finnish is related to languages like Me√§nkieli and Kven, which are spoken in neighboring countries. The language has a unique structure, using suffixes to change words' meanings. Sentences usually follow a subject-verb-object order, but the language's inflection system allows for flexibility. Finnish uses the Latin alphabet and has distinct vowel and consonant lengths, as well as diphthongs.",
