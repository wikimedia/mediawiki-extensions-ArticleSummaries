	"summary": "Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), a strong plastic made of carbon and fluorine, is widely known as the non-stick coating on cookware. Its slippery surface also makes it useful in machinery to reduce friction and in medical devices like catheters. PTFE is highly resistant to chemicals, making it ideal for containers holding reactive substances. However, its production involves persistent pollutants called PFAS, which have raised health and environmental concerns. DuPont, a major PTFE producer, phased out one harmful chemical (PFOA) but replaced it with another (GenX).",
