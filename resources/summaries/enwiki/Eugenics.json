	"summary": "Eugenics is the idea of improving human genes by controlling who has babies. It started in the late 1800s and was popular in many countries. People thought they could make their populations healthier and smarter. This was done by encouraging \"good\" people to have more kids and stopping \"unfit\" people from having any.\n\nIn the past, eugenics meant taking away the freedom of those deemed \"inferior.\" Today, it's linked to racism and discrimination. Some early eugenicists focused on intelligence and social class.",
