	"summary": "## The Great Library of Alexandria\n\nThe Great Library of Alexandria, in Egypt, was one of the ancient world's biggest and most important libraries. It was part of a research center called the Mouseion.  Founded by the Ptolemaic kings, it collected tens of thousands of papyrus scrolls.\n\nFamous scholars worked there, making important discoveries in literature, math, science, and more. Over time, the library declined due to political turmoil, a lack of funding, and eventually, destruction from war.  While parts of the library may have survived into the 3rd century AD, it ultimately vanished, leaving behind a legacy as a symbol of ancient knowledge and learning.",
