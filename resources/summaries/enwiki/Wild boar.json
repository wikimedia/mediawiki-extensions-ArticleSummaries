	"summary": "The wild boar is a wild pig species found across Eurasia and North Africa. It's one of the most widespread mammals globally and is adaptable to various habitats. These boars live in groups led by females and their young. Males usually roam alone outside breeding season. Wolves, tigers, and Komodo dragons are their main predators.\n\nWild boars are important as they are the ancestors of domestic pigs and have been hunted for sport for a long time. They can interbreed with feral pigs, creating hybrids that are a nuisance in some areas.",
