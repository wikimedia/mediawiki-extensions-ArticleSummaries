	"summary": "Natural numbers are the counting numbers you use every day: 1, 2, 3, and so on. Some people include zero (0) as the first natural number, while others start with one (1). These numbers help us count objects, like apples, and order things, like cities by size. They're also used as labels, like jersey numbers.\n\nIn math, natural numbers are the foundation for other number sets, like integers (including negative numbers) and real numbers (including decimals). They are studied in various math areas, such as number theory and combinatorics, to understand patterns and relationships between numbers.",
