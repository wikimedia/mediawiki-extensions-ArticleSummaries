	"summary": "Honey is a sweet, thick liquid made by bees from plant nectar. Bees store honey in their hives to eat later. People also collect honey from beehives to use as food. It's sweet because it contains sugars called fructose and glucose. Honey doesn't spoil easily and has been found still edible in ancient tombs. Humans have been collecting and using honey for thousands of years, as shown in cave paintings and ancient Mayan practices.",
