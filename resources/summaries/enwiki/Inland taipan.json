	"summary": "## Inland Taipan\n\nThe inland taipan is a highly venomous snake found in central east Australia. Its venom is the most toxic of any snake, able to kill over 100 people with one bite! Despite this, it's usually shy and tries to avoid people. It's called \"fierce\" for its venom, not its personality.  It's rarely seen because it lives in remote areas.",
