	"summary": "The Iroquois, also called the Six Nations, are a group of Native American tribes. They speak the Iroquoian language and live in northeast North America. The tribes include Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, Seneca, and Tuscarora. They formed a powerful confederacy, known for their \"Great Law of Peace.\" This union helped them influence colonial policy. At their peak, they controlled areas from New York to Ontario and beyond. Other Iroquoian-speaking groups, like the Huron and Erie, were not part of the confederacy but shared a common language. Today, many Six Nations people live in Canada and the United States.",
