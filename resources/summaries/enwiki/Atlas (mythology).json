	"summary": "In Greek mythology, Atlas was a Titan who had to hold up the sky forever after a big battle, the Titanomachy. He's known for helping heroes like Heracles and Perseus. Atlas was thought to live at the world's edge in the west, and later was linked to the Atlas Mountains in Africa. He was said to be very smart, good at math and astronomy, and even invented the first celestial sphere. Atlas was the son of Titan Iapetus and Oceanid Asia or Clymene, and had many daughters, including the Hesperides, Hyades, Pleiades, and nymph Calypso. The term \"atlas\" now means a book of maps, and the Atlantic Ocean is named after him.",
