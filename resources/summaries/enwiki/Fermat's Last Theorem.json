	"summary": "Fermat's Last Theorem says there are no three positive numbers (a, b, c) that fit the equation a^n + b^n = c^n for any whole number n bigger than 2. Pierre Fermat wrote this around 1637, claiming he had a proof too big to write down. For 358 years, mathematicians tried to prove it, but couldn't. Finally, in 1994, Andrew Wiles found a proof, also proving part of another big math idea. This made Fermat's theorem one of the most famous in math history.",
