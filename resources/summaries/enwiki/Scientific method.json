Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Make a guess (hypothesis)** about how something works.\n2. **Predict** what would happen if your guess is true.\n3. **Test** your prediction with an experiment or observation.\n\nA good hypothesis can be proven wrong (falsified) by the results. The scientific method isn't always a straight line; scientists might repeat steps or approach them in different orders.",
