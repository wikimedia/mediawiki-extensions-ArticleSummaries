	"summary": "The WTO is a global organization based in Switzerland, with 166 countries as members. It helps countries trade with each other fairly by making and enforcing rules. These rules reduce trade barriers like taxes (tariffs) and limits (quotas). The WTO also solves disputes between countries when they don't follow the rules. It started in 1995, taking over from an older trade agreement. The WTO has increased global trade and influenced other trade agreements, but some people think the benefits aren't shared fairly.",
