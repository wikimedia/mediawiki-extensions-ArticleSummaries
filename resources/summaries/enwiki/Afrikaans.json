	"summary": "Afrikaans is a West Germanic language spoken mainly in South Africa, Namibia, and a few other African countries. It developed from Dutch, specifically the Hollandic dialect, in the 17th and 18th centuries. Although it has borrowed words from other languages, about 90-95% of its vocabulary is Dutch. Afrikaans is simpler grammatically and has distinct spelling. Speakers of Afrikaans and Dutch can usually understand each other, especially in writing.",
