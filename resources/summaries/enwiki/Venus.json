With a thick atmosphere mostly made of carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid clouds, it has the densest atmosphere of the terrestrial planets. The surface is incredibly hot, with temperatures over 800Â°F, and the pressure is 92 times greater than Earth's.\n\nVenus has a unique rotation, moving in the opposite direction to its orbit, and takes 224.7 Earth days to orbit the Sun. It has no moons and is one of the most accessible planets for interplanetary travel due to its proximity to Earth. Historically, Venus has been an important object in astronomy and human culture.",
