	"summary": "The Great Attractor is a massive region in space that pulls galaxies towards it, including our own Milky Way. It's like a giant magnet in the universe. Scientists estimate it has a mind-blowing 100 million billion times the mass of our sun!\n\nWe can't see it directly because it's hidden behind a dusty part of our galaxy. But we know it's there because we can see its effect on other galaxies. These galaxies are moving towards the Great Attractor, even though they are also moving away from each other due to the expansion of the universe.",
