	"summary": "Around 1200 BC, many ancient civilizations near the Mediterranean Sea and in the Middle East suddenly fell apart. This is called the Late Bronze Age collapse. Cities were destroyed, trade stopped, and powerful kingdoms like the Hittites and Mycenaeans disappeared. Some people think this was caused by invasions, natural disasters, or even new military technology. Others believe it might have been a combination of these factors. After this collapse, new cultures formed, and the world slowly started to change, leading to the Iron Age.",
