	"summary": "## Brown Recluse Spiders\n\nBrown recluse spiders are small, ranging from 0.25 to 0.8 inches. They are usually light to medium brown, but can be whitish to dark brown or blackish gray. They have a distinctive violin-shaped marking on their back, earning them nicknames like \"fiddleback spider,\" \"brown fiddler,\" or \"violin spider.\" Their bites can be serious, sometimes requiring medical attention due to their necrotic venom. They are one of three dangerous spiders in North America, along with black widows and Chilean recluses.",
