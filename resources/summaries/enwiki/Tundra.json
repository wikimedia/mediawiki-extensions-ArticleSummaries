	"summary": "Tundra is a cold, treeless biome found in Arctic, alpine, and Antarctic regions. Extreme temperatures and short growing seasons prevent tree growth. The landscape is dominated by low-growing plants like shrubs, grasses, and mosses.\n\nThe tundra soil is unique; it's rich in nutrients and contains lots of organic material. This soil is a significant store of carbon, but as the climate warms, this carbon is released as gases, contributing to global warming. The line where trees stop growing, called the tree line, marks the boundary between tundra and forested areas.",
