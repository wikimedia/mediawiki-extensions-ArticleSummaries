	"summary": "Mechanical engineering is a diverse field studying machines and their movement. It combines physics, math, and materials science to design and build systems like vehicles, robotics, and industrial equipment. Engineers use computer-based tools for designing and manufacturing.\n\nThis branch has a long history, dating back to ancient times, but it emerged as a formal discipline during the European Industrial Revolution. It continues to evolve, incorporating new technologies like nanotechnology and mechatronics. Mechanical engineers often collaborate with other engineering fields, like aerospace and electrical engineering, and they can also work in biomedical applications.",
