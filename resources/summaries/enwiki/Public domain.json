It includes books, music, art, and ideas where the original creator's rights have expired or been given away.\n\nThink of works by Shakespeare or Beethoven â€“ anyone can use them! Even recipes and scientific formulas are usually in the public domain.\n\nIt's important to remember that what's free in one country might not be free in another, so always check before you use something.",
