	"summary": "Harvestmen, also known as daddy longlegs, are an order of arachnids. There are over 6,650 discovered species worldwide, with possibly 10,000 more. They live on all continents except Antarctica. Harvestmen have a long history, with fossils found in Scotland and France dating back millions of years. Though they look like spiders, they are a separate group. They can be told apart by their fused body parts and single pair of eyes. The term \"daddy longlegs\" can also refer to other arthropods, like crane flies and cellar spiders.",
