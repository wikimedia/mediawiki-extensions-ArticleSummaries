	"summary": "Waldorf schools follow Rudolf Steiner's educational philosophy, focusing on holistic growth and creativity. Teachers have flexibility in teaching methods and curriculum. Student work is assessed qualitatively, with limited standardized testing.\n\nThe first Waldorf school opened in Germany in 1919, and the movement has since grown globally. However, it has faced controversies due to Steiner's racist associations, concerns over special education, and the spread of infectious diseases linked to vaccine hesitancy among some parents. Despite these issues, Waldorf education continues to be popular in many countries.",
