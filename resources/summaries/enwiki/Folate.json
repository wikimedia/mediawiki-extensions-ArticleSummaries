Since our bodies can't make it, we must get it from our diet. Folic acid, a stable form of folate, is often added to food and used as a supplement.\n\nFolate deficiency can cause anemia, tiredness, and other health issues. Pregnant women need extra folate to prevent birth defects. However, too much folic acid might increase prostate cancer risk and mask vitamin B12 deficiency. The recommended daily intake is 400 micrograms.",
