	"summary": "Feminism is about making sure women have the same rights and chances as men in all areas of life. It started in Europe a long time ago, and people who support it fight for things like equal pay, the right to vote, and an end to violence against women. Feminists also want to get rid of gender stereotypes and help women have more opportunities in school, work, and their personal lives.\n\nThere are different types of feminism, like liberal, socialist, and radical feminism, each with its own ideas. Some people think feminism should include helping men too, because traditional gender roles can hurt them as well.",
