	"summary": "MS-13, or Mara Salvatrucha, is a dangerous gang that started in Los Angeles in the 1980s to protect Salvadoran immigrants. It later became a big criminal group, rivaling the 18th Street gang. Many members were sent back to El Salvador, which is how the gang spread to Central America. Now, MS-13 is active in the USA, Canada, Mexico, and Central America, with most members being Central American. Despite its international presence, MS-13 makes up a small part of the total gang population and crimes in the United States.",
