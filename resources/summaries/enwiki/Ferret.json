	"summary": "Ferrets are small, domesticated animals related to polecats and other mustelids. They have long, slim bodies, and can be various colors. Males are bigger than females. Ferrets were likely first bred for hunting rabbits. Today, they are popular pets in North America, though rules about owning them differ by place. In some countries, they are restricted due to concerns about wild ferret-polecat hybrids harming local wildlife. Ferrets have also helped scientists study the brain and diseases like the flu. They are often mistaken for the black-footed ferret, a different species.",
