	"summary": "COPD is a lung disease that makes it hard to breathe and gets worse over time. It's often caused by smoking or air pollution. Symptoms include shortness of breath and coughing. There's no cure, but quitting smoking and certain treatments can help.\n\nTwo main types are emphysema (damaged lung tissue) and chronic bronchitis (long-term cough with mucus). These can happen separately but often occur together. COPD is a major global health issue, affecting millions and causing many deaths, especially in lower-income countries.",
