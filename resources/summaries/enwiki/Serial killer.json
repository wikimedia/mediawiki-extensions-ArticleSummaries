	"summary": "A serial killer is someone who murders three or more people over a long period, often for psychological satisfaction. They might kill for excitement, money, or attention. These killers often have a pattern, choosing victims with similar traits. The FBI says they may have anger issues or personality disorders, but most aren't legally considered insane. Serial killers are different from mass or spree killers, but there can be some overlap.",
