	"summary": "## Gravitational Constant (G)\n\nThe gravitational constant (G) is a key number in physics. It helps us calculate how gravity works, both in Newton's laws and Einstein's theory of relativity.  Think of it like a bridge between the mass of objects and the force of gravity pulling them together.  Its value is very small, meaning gravity is weak compared to other forces.  We've known about G for a long time, thanks to Henry Cavendish's experiment in 1798.",
