	"summary": "The Legion of Frontiersmen was a paramilitary group active in Edmonton, Canada, in 1915. Paramilitary organizations are like armies but aren't officially recognized by the government. These groups often have their own rules and goals. The Legion of Frontiersmen was nationalist, meaning they likely wanted to protect or promote their country's interests. They were not connected to the Canadian Army. The term \"paramilitary\" has been used since at least 1934 to describe such organizations.",
