	"summary": "Ancient history is like a giant storybook, starting when people first started writing things down, around 5,000 years ago. It covers a time when humans lived on every continent, from 3000 BC to about 500 AD. This period is often split into three ages: Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age.\n\nDuring this time, the world's population grew really fast. It went from 2 million people in 10,000 BC to 209 million by the end of ancient times. That's like a 100-times increase! This growth was partly because of new farming techniques that people started using.",
