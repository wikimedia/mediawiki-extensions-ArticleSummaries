	"summary": "Beryllium is a rare, steel-gray metal with the symbol Be. It's strong, lightweight, and mostly found in minerals like beryl (which includes aquamarine and emerald). This element is used in aerospace because it's light yet very sturdy. It's also great for X-ray equipment since it lets radiation pass through easily.\n\nBeryllium is often added to other metals like aluminum and copper to make them stronger. However, it can be dangerous if inhaled, causing a serious lung disease called berylliosis. So, special safety measures are needed when working with it.",
