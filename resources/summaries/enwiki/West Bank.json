	"summary": "The West Bank is a Palestinian territory located near the Mediterranean Sea. It is named for its position west of the Jordan River. Israel has occupied this region since 1967, which is considered illegal by the International Court of Justice.\n\nHistorically, Jordan controlled the West Bank after the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. During the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel took control. The territory is divided into three areas, with the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) having varying levels of control.\n\nThe West Bank is significant in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Palestinians want it as part of their future state, while some Israelis want to annex it due to its historical and religious importance. Many Israeli settlers live in the area, which is also considered illegal under international law.",
