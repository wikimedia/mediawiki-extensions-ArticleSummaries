	"summary": "Elephants are the biggest land animals, with three species: African bush, African forest, and Asian elephants. They have a trunk for grabbing things, tusks for defense, and big ears for staying cool. These creatures live in Africa and Asia, eating plants and staying near water. Elephants are social, living in family groups led by a matriarch. Males leave their families as they grow up. Elephants can communicate over long distances and are very smart. Unfortunately, they are in danger due to poaching for ivory, habitat loss, and conflicts with humans.",
