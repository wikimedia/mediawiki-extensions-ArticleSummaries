	"summary": "Greek fire was a powerful weapon used by the Byzantine Empire. It was a burning liquid that could even burn on water, making it very dangerous for enemy ships. The Byzantines kept the recipe a secret, but it was likely made from petroleum and resins. They would launch it at enemy ships using grenades or tubes, causing huge fires. This weapon was so effective that other countries couldn't copy it. It was used from the 7th to the 14th century.",
