	"summary": "In Western astrology, the zodiac is divided into 12 signs, each representing a 30-degree slice of the sky. These signs start with Aries at the beginning of spring and include Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, and so on. The zodiac originated from Babylonian astrology and was later influenced by Greek culture. Each sign is named after a constellation. However, due to Earth's wobble (axial precession), these signs no longer line up exactly with the constellations. Astrology is considered a pseudoscience, as scientific studies have found no evidence to support its claims.",
