	"summary": "A steam engine is a machine that uses steam to do work. It has a cylinder where steam pushes a piston back and forth. This movement is turned into rotating power by a connecting rod and crank.\n\nPeople have used steam power since ancient times, but it was Thomas Newcomen in 1712 who made the first practical steam engine. James Watt improved it in 1764, making it even more powerful and efficient.\n\nSteam engines were crucial during the Industrial Revolution, powering factories, trains, and ships. However, they were replaced by electric motors and internal combustion engines in the 20th century. Today, large steam engines are still made in Germany.",
