	"summary": "The Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS) categorizes hurricanes based on their sustained wind speeds. It ranges from Category 1 (weakest) to Category 5 (strongest). To be a hurricane, a tropical cyclone must have winds of at least 74 mph (Category 1). Category 5 storms have winds of at least 157 mph. This scale helps predict the damage a hurricane might cause when it reaches land. It's only used for hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean and northern Pacific Ocean. Some critics say it's too simple because it doesn't consider factors like rain and storm surge.",
