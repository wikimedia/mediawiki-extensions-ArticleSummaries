	"summary": "Constellations are star patterns in the night sky, often named after animals, myths, or objects. People have created them since ancient times to tell stories and navigate. There are 88 officially recognized constellations, with 12 in the zodiac. The ancient Greeks and Romans named many, and astronomers use Latin names for them. In 1922, the International Astronomical Union made a list of these constellations, helping everyone agree on what to call them. Some star groups, called asterisms, are not official constellations but are still useful for finding your way around the sky.",
