	"summary": "A black hole is a super-dense object in space with a powerful gravitational pull. It's like a bottomless pit where nothing, not even light, can escape. This is because its gravity warps the fabric of space and time. Black holes form when massive stars die and collapse. They can grow by swallowing nearby matter.\n\nScientists first thought of black holes in the 1700s, but it wasn't until the 1900s that they were fully understood with Einstein's theory. We can't see black holes directly, but we know they're there by how they affect nearby stars and light.",
