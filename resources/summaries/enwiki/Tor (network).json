	"summary": "Tor is a free and open-source network that helps people communicate anonymously online. It works by bouncing internet traffic through a random path of over 7,000 volunteer-run servers worldwide. This makes it hard to track a user's online activities, protecting their privacy and location. With Tor, no single person can see both where the internet traffic starts and where it ends, ensuring confidential communication and freedom from network surveillance.",
