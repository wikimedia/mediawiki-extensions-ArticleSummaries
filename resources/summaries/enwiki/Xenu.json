	"summary": "Xenu, also known as Xemu, is a character in the Church of Scientology's secret teachings. According to these teachings, Xenu was an alien leader who brought his people to Earth 75 million years ago and killed them near volcanoes. Their spirits, called thetans, still affect humans and cause spiritual harm. This story, called \"Incident II,\" is only shared with high-level Scientology members because it's considered very powerful and potentially dangerous to think about. The church keeps it a secret, but parts of the story have leaked online. Many scholars find it interesting and compare it to science fiction, UFO beliefs, and ancient myths.",
