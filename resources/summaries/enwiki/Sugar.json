	"summary": "Sugar is a sweet carbohydrate found in many foods. It comes in simple forms like glucose and fructose, and compound forms like sucrose (table sugar). White sugar is a refined version of sucrose. Our bodies break down compound sugars into simple ones.\n\nNatural sources include fruits and honey. Sugarcane and sugar beet are used for commercial sugar production. We consume about 24 kg of sugar yearly, with some regions eating much more. High sugar intake can harm health, leading to recommendations to limit it to less than 10% of daily calories.",
