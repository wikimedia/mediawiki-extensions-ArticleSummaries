	"summary": "Raccoons are large, intelligent mammals native to North America, known for their dexterous paws and distinctive mask-like facial markings. They can weigh up to 57 pounds and are mostly nocturnal and omnivorous. Their fur keeps them warm in cold weather.\n\nThese animals are adaptable, living in various environments, including cities, where they might be considered pests. They have also spread to Europe and Japan. Raccoons are social, with females sharing spaces and males living in small groups. They usually give birth to 2-5 young, called kits, each spring. In the wild, raccoons live for about 1.8 to 3.1 years.",
