	"summary": "Bipolar II disorder is a mood condition where people experience periods of hypomania (a milder form of mania) and depression. It's different from Bipolar I, as it doesn't involve full manic episodes. Hypomania can still affect daily life, but it doesn't include psychosis. Diagnosis is tricky as hypomania may seem like high energy or personality traits. People often seek help during depression, making it hard for doctors to spot the pattern. It's more common than Bipolar I, and proper diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment.",
