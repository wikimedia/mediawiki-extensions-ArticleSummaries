	"summary": "The Komodo dragon is the biggest lizard in the world, found on some Indonesian islands. They can grow up to 9.8 feet long and weigh 330 pounds! These reptiles are apex predators, meaning they're at the top of their food chain. They hunt and ambush birds, mammals, and even invertebrates.\n\nKomodo dragons are unique as they hunt in groups, which is rare for reptiles. They mainly eat a type of deer called Javan rusa but also feed on dead animals (carrion). These dragons can live up to 30 years, taking almost a decade to fully grow. They are endangered due to human activities and climate change.",
