	"summary": "Ellis Island, located in New York Harbor, was once the main entry point for immigrants coming to the United States. Between 1892 and 1954, almost 12 million people passed through its doors. Now a national museum, the island was named after Samuel Ellis, who owned it in the 1700s. Over time, the island was expanded and used for different purposes, including a military base and a detention center. Today, visitors can take a ferry to explore the museum and learn about the island's history and the immigrants who started new lives there.",
