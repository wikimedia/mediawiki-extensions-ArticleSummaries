	"summary": "The golden ratio, often symbolized by the Greek letter phi (Ï†), is a special number (about 1.618) that appears in many places in math and nature. It's when the ratio of two things is the same as the ratio of their sum to the bigger one.\n\nImagine a rectangle where the long side is 1 unit longer than the short side. This \"golden rectangle\" has a special property: you can cut it into a square and a smaller golden rectangle. This is related to the golden ratio.\n\nArtists and nature both show this ratio, making it an interesting and important concept in math and design.",
