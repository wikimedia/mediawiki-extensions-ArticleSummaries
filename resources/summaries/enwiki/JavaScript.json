Most websites use JavaScript to add features like animations and form validation.\n\nWeb browsers have a special program, called a JavaScript engine, to run this language. It can also be used in servers and other apps, with Node.js being a common choice. JavaScript is versatile, supporting different programming styles and providing tools for various tasks, but it doesn't handle certain tasks like graphics or networking on its own.",
