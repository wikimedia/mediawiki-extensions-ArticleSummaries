The disease was deadly, killing about 30% of those infected. It left survivors with scars and sometimes blindness. Smallpox has a long history, affecting people for thousands of years. It was a major cause of death in Europe and killed many Native Americans after being introduced from Europe.\n\nThanks to vaccination and global efforts, smallpox was eradicated in 1980, making it the only human disease completely eliminated. The last natural case was in 1977. Today, only a few labs keep samples for research.",
