	"summary": "The Kingdom of Aksum was a powerful empire in East Africa and Arabia from ancient times until the Middle Ages. It began in the 1st century and was based in modern-day Ethiopia and Eritrea. The kingdom's capital, Axum, was a major trade center. At its peak, Aksum controlled parts of Yemen and was one of the world's great powers. They adopted Christianity in the 4th century and became known for their unique culture. However, over time, trade declined, and invasions weakened the kingdom. By the 7th century, Aksum's power faded, and it eventually collapsed around 960.",
