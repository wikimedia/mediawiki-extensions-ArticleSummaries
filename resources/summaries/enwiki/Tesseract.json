	"summary": "## The Dalí Cross and the Tesseract\n\nA tesseract is a four-dimensional shape, like a cube but with more sides. You can imagine it as eight cubes connected at right angles. It's also called a hypercube. The Dalí cross is a 2D pattern that shows how a tesseract can be unfolded, similar to how a cube can be unfolded into squares. The name \"tesseract\" comes from Greek words meaning \"four rays,\" referring to the four lines meeting at each corner.",
