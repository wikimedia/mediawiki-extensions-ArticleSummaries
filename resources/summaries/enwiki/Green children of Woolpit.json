	"summary": "In the 12th century, two green-skinned children, a brother and sister, appeared in the English village of Woolpit. They spoke an unknown language and only ate raw broad beans. Over time, they lost their green color and learned English, saying they came from a land with dim light. The boy died young, while the girl adapted but was considered mischievous. The story was first written about by William of Newburgh and Ralph of Coggeshall. Some think it's a folktale about meeting otherworldly beings, while others believe it's a real event described confusingly. The tale inspired the anarchist poet Herbert Read and his novel \"The Green Child.\"",
