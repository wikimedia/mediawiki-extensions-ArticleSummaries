	"summary": "The National Security Agency (NSA) is a U.S. intelligence agency that collects and protects information to keep the country safe. It was started after World War II to decode secret messages. The NSA has about 32,000 employees and works secretly to monitor data from around the world. It also protects U.S. communication networks. In 2013, some of its secret activities were made public, showing it collects data from many people's phones and computers. This caused political debates about privacy. Unlike the CIA, the NSA mainly focuses on electronic information rather than using people to gather secrets.",
