	"summary": "Rotaviruses are a common cause of diarrhea in babies and young kids, with almost every child getting infected at least once by age five. These viruses are spread through contact with infected poop and can cause severe gastroenteritis, but adults are rarely affected. There are many types of rotaviruses, with Rotavirus A being the most common. Though discovered in 1973, its seriousness was not fully recognized, especially in poorer countries. Rotavirus can be deadly, causing about 150,000 deaths in young children worldwide in 2019. Vaccines have helped lower these numbers, especially in the United States.",
