	"summary": "Pedophilia is a rare and complex mental health condition where an adult or older teen feels sexually attracted to young children who haven't reached puberty yet. This usually means they're attracted to kids under 13. It's important to know that pedophilia is different from actually abusing a child. Not all pedophiles act on their feelings, and many would never hurt a child.\n\nDoctors and scientists don't fully understand what causes pedophilia, but they're studying it to find better ways to help people with this condition and protect children. There's no \"cure,\" but there are treatments that can help.",
