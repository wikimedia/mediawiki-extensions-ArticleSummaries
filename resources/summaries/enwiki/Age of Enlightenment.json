	"summary": "The Age of Enlightenment was a big thinking time in Europe a long time ago, from the 1600s to the 1700s. Smart people like Ren√© Descartes and Isaac Newton helped start it. They believed in using your brain and thinking for yourself, not just believing what others say. They talked about ideas like freedom, learning, and being nice to each other. This way of thinking changed how people saw the world and made way for big changes in politics and society. It even started the French Revolution!",
