	"summary": "QWERTY is a keyboard design named after the first six keys on the top row: Q, W, E, R, T, and Y. It was first used on a typewriter in 1874 and became very popular with the Remington No. 2 typewriter in 1878. This layout is still used on most computer keyboards today. The QWERTY layout was created to slow down typists and prevent jamming, as early typewriters were prone to doing when keys were pressed too quickly.",
