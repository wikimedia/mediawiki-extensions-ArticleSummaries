	"summary": "## Neutron Stars: Tiny, Dense Stellar Remnants\n\nNeutron stars are incredibly dense stars formed when massive stars explode. They pack more mass than our Sun into a city-sized sphere.  \n\nThese stars spin very fast and some shoot out powerful beams of light, becoming visible as pulsars. They are extremely hot when born, but cool down over millions of years. Neutron stars in pairs can produce powerful X-rays and gravitational waves. Scientists estimate there are billions of neutron stars in our galaxy, but they're hard to find because they don't give off much light.",
