	"summary": "Atmospheric pressure is the weight of the air around us, measured in units like pascals (Pa) or millibars (mb). The standard atmosphere (atm) is set at 101,325 Pa, which is the average pressure at sea level. As you go higher up, the pressure decreases because there's less air above you. This pressure is important in weather forecasting and aviation. It's caused by the pull of gravity on the Earth's atmosphere, and it affects how we feel the weight of the air around us.",
