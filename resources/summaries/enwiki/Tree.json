	"summary": "Trees are tall plants with trunks and branches, usually living for many years. They can be found all over the world and come in various types, like the common ash and European larch. Trees are important because they:\n- Provide food and homes for animals.\n- Help control the climate and reduce erosion.\n- Store carbon, which is good for the environment.\n- Offer us wood, fruit, and many other useful things.\n\nThere are different kinds of trees, and they reproduce using seeds, cones, or spores. Unfortunately, many trees are being cut down to make more space for farming.",
