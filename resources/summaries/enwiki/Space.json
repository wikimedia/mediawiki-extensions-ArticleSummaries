	"summary": "In physics, **space** is like a big, three-dimensional box where objects exist. We use a special system, called a **Cartesian coordinate system**, to find where things are in this space. It's like giving directions using left/right, forward/backward, and up/down.\n\nMathematicians also study **non-Euclidean geometries**, where space can be curved, not just flat. This is important in understanding the universe, especially near big objects like planets, as described by **Albert Einstein**'s theory of **general relativity**.",
