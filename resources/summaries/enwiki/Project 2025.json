	"summary": "Project 2025 is a plan by a conservative think tank, The Heritage Foundation, that imagines a future with Donald Trump as president and outlines major changes to US policies and government structure. It proposes giving the president full control of the executive branch, replacing civil servants with political appointees, and infusing government with Christian values. The project includes controversial ideas like criminalizing pornography, cutting funding for climate research, and rejecting abortion as healthcare. While the project has faced criticism for its authoritarian and Christian nationalist tendencies, its proponents argue it would dismantle a liberal bureaucracy. Despite some distance created between Trump and the project in the 2024 campaign, critics point to its close ties to Trump and his allies.",
