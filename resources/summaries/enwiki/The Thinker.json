	"summary": "\"The Thinker\" is a famous bronze statue by artist Auguste Rodin. It shows a large, naked man sitting on a rock, with his chin resting on his hand, deep in thought. This powerful image is often linked to philosophy.\n\nRodin first designed it for a larger artwork called \"The Gates of Hell\" in 1880. However, the first big bronze version was made in 1904 and is now in Paris. There are 27 full-sized copies, with many smaller versions and studies.",
