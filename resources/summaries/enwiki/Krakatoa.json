	"summary": "Krakatoa is a volcanic group of islands in Indonesia, between Java and Sumatra. It was mostly destroyed in a massive eruption in 1883, creating a large crater called a caldera. Over time, new islands formed within the caldera. The most recent island, Anak Krakatoa, emerged in 1927. Krakatoa has been active again since the 20th century, with a major eruption in 2018 causing a deadly tsunami.",
