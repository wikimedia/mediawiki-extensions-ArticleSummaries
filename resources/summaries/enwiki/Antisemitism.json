	"summary": "Antisemitism is when people dislike or treat Jews unfairly just because of their religion or where they come from. It's a type of racism. Some people might not like Jews because they think they are a different race with bad traits, or because of their religious beliefs. This has led to many sad events in history, like violence, pogroms, and even genocide.\n\nThe word \"antisemitism\" is tricky; it doesn't mean hatred of all Semitic people (which is a made-up idea). It's just a fancy way to say \"Jew-hatred.\"",
