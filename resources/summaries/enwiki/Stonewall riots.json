	"summary": "The Stonewall riots began on June 28, 1969, in New York City when the police raided a gay bar called the Stonewall Inn. This event marked a turning point for the gay rights movement. Gay people fought back against unfair treatment by the government. In the 1950s and 1960s, being gay was illegal in many places, and gay bars were often the only welcoming spaces. After the riots, activists formed groups to fight for gay rights, and pride parades were organized to remember this important moment. Now, pride events are celebrated worldwide every June.",
