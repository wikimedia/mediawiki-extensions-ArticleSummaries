	"summary": "Lactose is a type of sugar found in milk. It's made up of two simpler sugars, galactose and glucose, joined together. Carbohydrates, or saccharides, are molecules made of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. They come in different sizes, like simple sugars (monosaccharides) and larger ones like starch and cellulose. Carbohydrates are important in our bodies and food. For example, starch is in cereals and potatoes, and lactose is in milk and dairy products. Some carbohydrates help our digestion and feed good bacteria in our gut.",
