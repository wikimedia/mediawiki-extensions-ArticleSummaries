	"summary": "Olympus Mons is a massive volcano on Mars, standing over 21 kilometers tall. It's the tallest mountain in our solar system, even taller than Mount Everest. This mountain is located in the Tharsis region and last erupted millions of years ago. Scientists have studied it for a long time, first spotting it from Earth in the 1800s. Space probes later revealed its true size. Two craters on the volcano, Karzok and Pangboche, might be linked to Martian meteorites found on Earth.",
