	"summary": "The unification of Italy, also called the Risorgimento, was a 19th-century movement that led to the creation of the Kingdom of Italy in 1861. It began with rebellions against the Congress of Vienna's decisions and was influenced by the 1848 revolutions. Key figures like King Victor Emmanuel II, Cavour, Garibaldi, and Mazzini played vital roles. The process ended in 1871 when Rome became the capital.\n\nItaly celebrates unification on March 17th. Some Italian-speaking areas joined later, after World War I, with the Treaty of Rapallo in 1920. This event is seen as a continuation of the Risorgimento by some historians.",
