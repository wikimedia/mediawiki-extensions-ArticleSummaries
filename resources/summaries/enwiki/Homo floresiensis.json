	"summary": "Homo floresiensis, or \"Flores Man,\" was a small ancient human species that lived on the Indonesian island of Flores until around 50,000 years ago. They were about 3.5 feet tall and their remains were found in a cave called Liang Bua. Scientists think they may have shrunk in size due to living on an island, a process called insular dwarfism. Some believe they evolved from an earlier human species, like Homo erectus, while others think they might be related to even older African human ancestors.",
