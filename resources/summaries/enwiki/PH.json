	"summary": "pH is a way to measure how acidic or basic a liquid (like water) is. It's like a scale from 0 to 14. Lower numbers mean it's more acidic (like lemon juice), and higher numbers mean it's more basic (like soap). A pH of 7 is neutral, just like pure water.\n\nScientists use special tools to measure pH, like a pH meter or color-changing papers. This helps them in many fields, such as chemistry, medicine, and taking care of the environment.",
