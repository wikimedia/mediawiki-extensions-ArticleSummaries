	"summary": "Vikings were brave explorers from Scandinavia who sailed their longships across Europe and beyond between the 8th and 11th centuries. They raided, traded, and settled in many places, including the British Isles, France, and even as far as North America. With their excellent sailing skills, they established new homes and governments in various regions. The Vikings had a big impact on the history of many countries. They spoke Old Norse, made runic inscriptions, and later adopted Christianity. Despite popular beliefs, they were not just violent raiders; they were also farmers, traders, and craftspeople.",
