	"summary": "Cats, or *Felis catus*, are small, meat-eating mammals that have been our pets for a very long time. They were first domesticated in the Near East over 9,000 years ago. Cats are great hunters with sharp teeth and retractable claws, perfect for catching mice. They are known for their good hearing and sense of smell.\n\nThese social animals love to communicate with meows, purrs, and body language. Female cats can have babies (kittens) several times a year, and people often breed them for shows. Cats are super popular pets, with millions of them living in homes worldwide.",
