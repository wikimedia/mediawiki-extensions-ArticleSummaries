	"summary": "The United Kingdom (UK) was formed in 1801 when Great Britain and Ireland united. It became a powerful global force, especially after defeating France in the Napoleonic Wars. The UK had a strong navy and controlled a vast empire, including parts of Africa and Asia.\n\nOver time, the UK gave more power to local governments in colonies with white settlers, like Canada and Australia, which became self-governing dominions. The British Empire expanded, but there were also challenges, such as the Great Irish Famine.\n\nIn the early 1900s, the UK formed alliances to counter Germany's growing power, leading to World War I. After the war, Ireland gained partial independence, and the UK was renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 1927.",
