	"summary": "A world's fair, or expo, is a big global event where countries show off their cool achievements. These fairs happen in different places around the world and last for a few months. They're like a huge international party! The first one was in 1851 in London.\n\nThe name \"world's fair\" is mostly used in the USA, while other countries call it a \"universal exhibition.\" There are different kinds of expos, like World Expos and Specialised Expos. A special group called the Bureau International des Expositions (BIE) makes sure these events are official. Recent expos were in Kazakhstan, Dubai, and Qatar.",
