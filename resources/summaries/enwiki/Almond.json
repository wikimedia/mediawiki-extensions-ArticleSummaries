	"summary": "Almonds are fruits from a tree called *Prunus amygdalus*. They are not true nuts but seeds inside a hard shell. Almonds are used in many foods, especially desserts. The tree grows best in cool, Mediterranean climates. California grows most of the world's almonds, but this might be a problem because it needs a lot of water and pesticides. Droughts in California are making almond farming harder.",
