	"summary": "UTC is the global time standard that helps us tell time. It's like a reference point for all clocks and time zones around the world. Most countries use UTC to keep their time consistent. UTC is based on the time at the Prime Meridian (0Â° longitude) and is kept accurate by atomic clocks.\n\nIt was first used in 1963 and has been adjusted a few times, mostly by adding extra seconds (leap seconds). Recently, there's been talk of removing leap seconds to make timekeeping more stable.",
