	"summary": "The Navier–Stokes equations are math formulas named after scientists Claude-Louis Navier and George Gabriel Stokes. They help us understand how viscous fluids, like water or air, move. These equations are like a recipe, using math to describe how pressure and temperature affect fluid flow. They're useful for many things, such as designing planes, cars, and even studying how blood moves in our bodies. Despite being helpful, there's still a big mystery about these equations, as mathematicians haven't yet proven if they always have smooth solutions.",
