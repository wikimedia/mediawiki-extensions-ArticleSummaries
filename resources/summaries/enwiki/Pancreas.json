	"summary": "The pancreas is a vital organ in your body, located near your stomach. It has two main jobs: helping with digestion and controlling blood sugar. As part of the digestive system, it produces juices with enzymes to break down food. For blood sugar control, it releases hormones like insulin and glucagon.\n\nThis organ can get inflamed, a condition called pancreatitis, which can be caused by drinking too much alcohol or gallstones. Pancreatic cancer is also serious and often hard to detect early. The name 'pancreas' comes from Greek words meaning \"all flesh.\"",
