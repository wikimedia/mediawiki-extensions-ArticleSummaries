	"summary": "## The East-West Schism\n\nThe East-West Schism split the Christian church into two main groups: the Catholic Church in the West and the Eastern Orthodox Church in the East. This happened in 1054 because of arguments about religious beliefs, customs, and who had the most power.\n\nThere were fights over things like how the Holy Spirit moves, what kind of bread to use in church services, and even politics.  Both sides accused each other of being wrong, and they stopped sharing religious practices.\n\nAlthough there have been attempts to get along, the two churches still aren't fully united today.",
