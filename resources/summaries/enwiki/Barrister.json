	"summary": "A barrister is a specialized lawyer who focuses on representing clients in court. They argue cases, prepare legal documents, and provide expert legal advice. Unlike solicitors, barristers primarily work on litigation and advocacy. In some countries, like England and Wales, barristers can manage cases directly, but in others, they must work under the guidance of a solicitor. This role is unique to common law systems and is not found in the US legal system.",
