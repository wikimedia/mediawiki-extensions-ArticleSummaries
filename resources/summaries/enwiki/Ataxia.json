	"summary": "Ataxia is a problem with muscle coordination due to a faulty nervous system. It can make walking, talking, and eye movements difficult. The root cause is often an issue with the cerebellum, a part of the brain that controls movement.\n\nThere are various types, like hemiataxia (affecting one side of the body) and Friedreich's ataxia (mainly affecting walking). Dystaxia is a mild form. This condition can be recognized by changes in how a person moves and speaks.",
