	"summary": "The Spanish Inquisition was started in 1478 by King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella to ensure people followed the Catholic religion in their kingdoms. It was like a court that punished those who didn't obey Catholic rules, especially people who had changed their religion to Catholicism from Judaism or Islam.\n\nOver 300 years, around 150,000 people were punished, and a small number were executed. The Inquisition also forced many Jews and Muslims to convert or leave Spain. It ended in 1834 when the queen at that time, Isabella II, abolished it.",
