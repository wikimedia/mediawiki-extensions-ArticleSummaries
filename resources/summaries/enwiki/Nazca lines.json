	"summary": "The Nazca Lines are giant drawings in the desert of southern Peru, made between 500 BC and 500 AD. People created them by removing stones to reveal different-colored dirt. There are straight lines and shapes of animals and plants. They cover a large area and are best seen from the air.\n\nExperts believe these designs were made for religious reasons. New figures are still being discovered using drones. The Nazca Lines are a UNESCO World Heritage Site, but they face challenges from weather changes and people moving into the area.",
