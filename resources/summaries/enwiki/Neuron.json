	"summary": "Neurons are special cells that send electrical messages in our bodies. They help us sense things like touch and sound, and control our movements. These cells have different parts: dendrites receive signals, the soma is the cell body, and the axon sends signals to other cells.\n\nThere are three main types: sensory neurons detect stimuli, motor neurons control our muscles, and interneurons connect other neurons. Neurons communicate through synapses, using chemicals to pass signals. This process helps our brains and bodies work together.",
