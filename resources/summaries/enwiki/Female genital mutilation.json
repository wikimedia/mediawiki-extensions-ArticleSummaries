	"summary": "Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) is when part or all of a girl's or woman's private parts are cut or removed for non-medical reasons. It's mostly done in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, and by 2024, over 230 million girls and women worldwide had experienced this. FGM can happen from birth to puberty and beyond, often by a traditional circumciser using a blade. The practice is linked to gender inequality, religious beliefs, and ideas about purity. It can cause serious health problems and is illegal in many countries, but it's still happening, and the numbers are growing.",
