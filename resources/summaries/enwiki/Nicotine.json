	"summary": "Nicotine is a chemical found in tobacco plants and some other foods, like potatoes and tomatoes, but in very small amounts. It's a stimulant, which means it can make you feel more awake and less anxious. People often use it to help quit smoking, but it's also very addictive.\n\nNicotine works by affecting the brain's receptors, and it can lead to dependence. Withdrawal symptoms include feeling sad, stressed, and having trouble sleeping. It's not clear if nicotine causes cancer, but it is known to cause birth defects. Eating a lot of nicotine can be dangerous, but it's rare for this to happen.",
