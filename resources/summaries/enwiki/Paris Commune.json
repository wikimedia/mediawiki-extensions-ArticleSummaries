	"summary": "The Paris Commune was a short-lived government in Paris, France, in 1871. It was formed by soldiers and working-class people who wanted change. They took control after France's defeat in the Franco-Prussian War. The Commune made new rules, like separating church and state, and helping workers. But it only lasted two months before the French army stopped them. Many Communards were killed or sent to prison. This event was important for socialist ideas and influenced thinkers like Karl Marx.",
