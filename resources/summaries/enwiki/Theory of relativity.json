	"summary": "## A Revolution in Time and Space\n\nAlbert Einstein's theory of relativity changed how we understand the universe. It has two parts: special relativity, which explains how things work without gravity, and general relativity, which includes gravity.\n\nEinstein's ideas replaced older theories and introduced new concepts like spacetime, where space and time are connected. It also predicted things like black holes and gravitational waves, which scientists have since discovered. Relativity has been crucial for understanding the universe on a grand scale.",
