	"summary": "Alcatraz Island, located near San Francisco, was once a famous prison known for being inescapable due to its surrounding cold waters and strong currents. Before that, it served as a military base and prison. The prison closed in 1963 and is now a popular tourist site. Native American activists occupied the island in the late 1960s. Now managed by the National Park Service, visitors can explore the old prison, lighthouse, and military buildings. The island is also home to seabirds and unique natural features.",
