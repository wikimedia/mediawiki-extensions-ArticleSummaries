Palestinians protested and fought against Israeli occupation using violence like gunfights and suicide bombings. Israelis responded with military force. Many people died on both sides, including civilians. The uprising ended with a peace agreement where both sides agreed to stop fighting, release prisoners, and follow a peace plan.",
