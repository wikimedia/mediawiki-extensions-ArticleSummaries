	"summary": "The snow leopard is a rare and endangered big cat found in the mountains of Central and South Asia. With fewer than 10,000 adults left, it is classified as Vulnerable. These cats live in high, rocky areas and are known for their beautiful fur. Poaching and habitat loss are their main threats.\n\nSnow leopards were once thought to be unique, but scientists now believe they are related to other big cats in the Panthera genus. There might be two types of snow leopards, but more research is needed to confirm this. They are an important part of Kyrgyz culture.",
