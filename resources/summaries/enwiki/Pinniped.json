	"summary": "Seals, part of the pinniped family, are amazing marine animals. They come in three main types: walruses, eared seals (like sea lions), and earless seals. With over 30 species, they live in cold waters worldwide. These streamlined swimmers have flippers and are super flexible. Some can dive deeply and see, hear, and feel their surroundings well.\n\nSeals eat fish and invertebrates, and some even hunt penguins! They mate in the spring and summer, and moms take care of their pups. Sadly, some seal species are in trouble due to hunting, pollution, and climate change.",
