	"summary": "Karate is a martial art that started in Okinawa, Japan, and was influenced by Chinese fighting styles. It was created by blending local Okinawan techniques with Chinese ones. Originally called \"Chinese hand,\" it was later renamed \"empty hand\" to reflect its Japanese development.\n\nBanned from carrying swords, Okinawans created this unarmed combat for self-defense. It gained popularity in Japan after being introduced by masters like Gichin Funakoshi. The art spread globally, especially after World War II, and is now an Olympic sport. With millions of practitioners, karate teaches not only fighting skills but also discipline and respect.",
