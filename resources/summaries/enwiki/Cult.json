	"summary": "A cult is a group that demands total loyalty to its beliefs and leader. These groups often have unusual practices and are seen as different from what society considers normal. The term is not clearly defined and can be negative, especially when used for new religions or groups with extreme views. Cults have been studied by sociologists and opposed by Christian and secular anti-cult movements. Academics prefer the term \"new religious movement\" instead. Cults exist worldwide, varying in size from small local groups to large international organizations.",
