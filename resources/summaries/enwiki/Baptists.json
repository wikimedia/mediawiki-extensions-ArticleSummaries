	"summary": "Baptists are Christians who believe in baptizing only those who profess their faith, and they do this by fully immersing them in water. They follow several key ideas, like every person being responsible for their beliefs and that the Bible is the only rule for faith and practice. Baptists recognize two important rituals: baptism and communion.\n\nThe first Baptist church was started in 1609 by John Smyth in Amsterdam. He believed that only adults who believed should be baptized. This practice then spread to England, and Baptists there had different views on who could be saved. Thomas Helwys, another important figure, fought for religious freedom and separation of church and state.",
