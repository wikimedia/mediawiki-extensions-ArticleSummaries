Imagine a bunch of heights: a small standard deviation means most heights are similar, while a large standard deviation means heights vary a lot.\n\nIt's like measuring how \"wide\" a bell curve is.  The symbol Ïƒ (sigma) usually represents standard deviation.\n\nStandard deviation helps us understand data, spot outliers (numbers that are very different), and know how confident we can be in our findings.",
