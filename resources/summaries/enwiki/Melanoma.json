	"summary": "Melanoma is a serious type of skin cancer that starts in melanocytes, the cells that give our skin color. It often appears on the legs (in women) or back (in men). About a quarter of melanomas start from moles. Signs to watch for include changes in size, shape, color, or itching.\n\nToo much ultraviolet (UV) light, from the sun or tanning beds, is the main cause. People with fair skin, many moles, or a family history are at higher risk.\n\nAvoiding UV light and using sunscreen can help prevent it. Surgery is the main treatment, but for advanced cases, other therapies like immunotherapy may be used. Early detection is key to a successful cure.",
