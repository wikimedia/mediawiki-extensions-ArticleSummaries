	"summary": "Schizoid personality disorder (SzPD) is a mental health condition where people prefer to be alone and have trouble forming close relationships. They may seem emotionally cold and often daydream a lot. Symptoms usually start in childhood or teen years. The cause isn't clear, but it might be linked to genetics and other mental disorders. Treatment is hard because those with SzPD rarely seek help, but therapy and medicine might not be very effective anyway. People with this disorder may struggle with low life quality, loneliness, and bullying.",
