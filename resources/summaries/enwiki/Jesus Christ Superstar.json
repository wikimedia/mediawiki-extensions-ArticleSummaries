	"summary": "\"Jesus Christ Superstar\" is a rock opera, a musical told through songs. It's about the last days of Jesus, but with a modern twist. The story explores what Jesus and his followers might have felt and thought, especially Judas, who is unhappy with Jesus' choices. The lyrics use modern language and jokes, making it feel like a current story.\n\nAt first, people didn't want to produce it as a play, so they made an album. The album was so popular that it became a Broadway show in 1971. It was a huge success, making over $237 million by 1980. It even held the record for the longest-running musical in London for many years.",
