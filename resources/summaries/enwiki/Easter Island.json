	"summary": "Easter Island, also known as Rapa Nui, is a special place in the Pacific Ocean. It's famous for its huge stone statues, called moai, made by the Rapa Nui people. UNESCO recognizes it as a World Heritage Site.\n\nPeople believe the island was first settled around 800 to 1200 years ago. The Rapa Nui culture was thriving but faced challenges like deforestation. When Europeans arrived, the population had decreased. Chile took control in 1888, and today, the island is home to around 7,750 people, with many Rapa Nui identifying as native inhabitants.\n\nIts remote location makes Easter Island one of the world's most distant inhabited places.",
