	"summary": "CRISPR is a special DNA pattern found in bacteria and archaea. It helps them fight off viruses by remembering and attacking similar ones in the future. Scientists discovered that a protein called Cas9 can use CRISPR to cut and edit DNA precisely. This technology, called CRISPR-Cas9, allows researchers to change genes in living things, leading to new medical treatments and scientific discoveries. It is so important that the scientists who developed it won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2020.",
