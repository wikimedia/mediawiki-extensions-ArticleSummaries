	"summary": "Romanticism was an art and literature movement that started in Europe around 1780. It was a reaction to the scientific and logical thinking of the Enlightenment. Artists and writers wanted to celebrate nature, emotions, and the imagination. They often showed nature as powerful and mysterious, and they liked to explore the past, especially the Middle Ages. This movement also loved the exotic and mysterious. Romanticism ended around World War I but still influences art and music today. It's why we \"romanticize\" things, making them seem more emotional and beautiful.",
