The name comes from its wedge-shaped marks, made with a reed stylus. Cuneiform was used for over 2,000 years to write many languages, like Akkadian and Hittite.\n\nRediscovered in the 1600s, it was finally understood in the 1800s. Today, experts study cuneiform tablets, with large collections in museums worldwide. These tablets reveal stories and history from ancient civilizations.",
