	"summary": "Crane flies are large, mosquito-like insects belonging to the superfamily Tipuloidea. They have long legs and are often called \"daddy longlegs\" or \"mosquito hawks.\" There are over 15,500 species worldwide, with most found in the tropics. Some species date back to the Middle Triassic period, around 245 million years ago. Crane flies don't eat adult mosquitoes but are beneficial as their larvae, known as leatherjackets, feed on plants and help with decomposition.",
