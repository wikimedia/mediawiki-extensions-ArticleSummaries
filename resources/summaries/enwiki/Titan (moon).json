	"summary": "Titan is Saturn's biggest moon and the second-largest in our solar system. It's unique because it has a thick atmosphere, even denser than Earth's, and is the only place beyond Earth with stable liquid on its surface. This moon is huge, 50% bigger than our moon and larger than the planet Mercury. Discovered in 1655, Titan orbits Saturn about 1.2 million km away. Its atmosphere, mainly nitrogen and methane, creates a haze, making it hard to see the surface. Recent missions have revealed lakes of hydrocarbons and a landscape with dunes, rivers, and mountains.",
