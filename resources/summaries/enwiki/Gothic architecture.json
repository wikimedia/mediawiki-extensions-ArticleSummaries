	"summary": "Gothic architecture was popular in Europe from the 12th to 16th centuries. It started in northern France and spread across the continent. The style is known for its pointed arches, which led to new designs like rib vaults and flying buttresses. These features let in lots of light, especially through colorful stained glass windows.\n\nYou can see Gothic architecture in many old churches, cathedrals, and castles. Even though it was replaced by Renaissance styles, Gothic architecture had a revival in the 18th and 19th centuries, and some of its designs are still used today.",
