	"summary": "Copper is a soft metal with the symbol Cu. It's an excellent conductor of heat and electricity and has a unique pinkish-orange color. People have used copper for thousands of years, even in ancient times, because it's one of the few metals found in nature as a pure metal. It's used in many ways, like in buildings, coins, and to make bronze. Copper compounds can be blue or green and are used as pigments and to protect against bacteria and fungi. Our bodies also need a small amount of copper to stay healthy.",
