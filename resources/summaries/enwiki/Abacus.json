	"summary": "An abacus is a manual device used for math calculations. It has a frame with movable beads on rods, representing numbers in a base-ten system. Each rod stands for a digit. The beads on top represent fives, and those at the bottom represent ones.\n\nPeople in ancient times used abacuses for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Today, some countries still use them, especially where calculators are not available. They are also great teaching tools for kids to learn math basics.",
