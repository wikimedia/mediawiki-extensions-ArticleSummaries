	"summary": "Taiga, also called boreal forest, is the largest land biome, filled with coniferous trees like pines and spruces. It covers much of northern North America and Eurasia, including Canada, Alaska, Sweden, Finland, and Russia. The trees vary by region; for example, North America has mostly spruce trees, while Russia has a mix of spruces, pines, and larches. This biome is relatively new, forming about 12,000 years ago. Climate change now poses a threat to the taiga.",
