	"summary": "The Amazon River is the biggest river in the world when it comes to the amount of water it carries. It's also one of the longest rivers, maybe even the longest, though some say the Nile River is longer.\n\nThe Amazon starts in Peru, where the Mantaro River flows into the Apurímac River. These rivers join others to become the Ucayali River, which then meets the Marañón River to form the main part of the Amazon. Brazilians call this part the Solimões River until it meets the Rio Negro, creating what they call the Amazon River.\n\nThe Amazon River carries more water than any other river, with about 215,000–230,000 cubic meters per second! Its basin, the area where water flows into the river, is the largest in the world.",
