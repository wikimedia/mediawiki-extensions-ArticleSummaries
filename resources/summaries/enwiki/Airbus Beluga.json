	"summary": "The Airbus A300-600ST, nicknamed the Beluga, is a special wide-body plane used to carry big airplane parts and cargo. Because Airbus' factories are spread out, they needed a way to move large pieces to their assembly lines. They used old planes called Super Guppies but needed something better. So, they created the Beluga, based on their A300-600 plane. It flew for the first time in 1994 and is bigger, faster, and more efficient than the Super Guppy. Airbus built five Belugas, and they're still used today, even though a newer plane, the BelugaXL, is now in service.",
