	"summary": "Lichens are fascinating organisms formed by a partnership (symbiosis) between fungi, algae, and sometimes yeast. They come in various shapes and colors, from tiny branches to flat, leaf-like structures. You might find them on trees, rocks, or even soil. Lichens are not plants but can photosynthesize like plants, creating their own food. They are tough and can survive in extreme places, from deserts to the Arctic. With around 20,000 species, lichens play a crucial role in ecosystems, providing food for animals like reindeer and helping to break down rocks over time.",
