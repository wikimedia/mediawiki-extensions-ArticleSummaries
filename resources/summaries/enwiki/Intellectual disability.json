	"summary": "Intellectual disability (ID) is a condition that starts in childhood, making it hard for someone to learn and do everyday tasks. It's when a person's brain doesn't develop typically, affecting their thinking, reasoning, and problem-solving skills. People with ID might have a lower IQ and struggle with important life skills like communication, self-care, and social interactions.\n\nThere are two types: syndromic, where ID is part of a larger set of symptoms, and non-syndromic, where ID stands alone. Down syndrome and fragile X syndrome are examples of the first type. ID is fairly common, affecting around 2-3% of people, and most have mild cases. The cause is often unknown, but genetics play a role in some cases.",
