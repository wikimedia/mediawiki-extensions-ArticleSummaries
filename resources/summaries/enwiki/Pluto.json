	"summary": "Pluto is a small, icy world located in a region called the Kuiper belt beyond Neptune. It is considered a dwarf planet, meaning it orbits the Sun but is not big enough to be classified as a regular planet. Pluto is known for its unique orbit, which sometimes brings it closer to the Sun than Neptune. It has five moons, with Charon being the largest. In 2015, a spacecraft called New Horizons visited Pluto, giving us amazing pictures and information about this distant world.",
