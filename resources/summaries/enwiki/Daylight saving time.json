	"summary": "Daylight Saving Time (DST) is when we adjust our clocks to make the most of summer's longer days. We set clocks forward by one hour in spring and back by one hour in autumn. Not everyone uses DSTâ€”it's mostly for places with big differences in daylight hours between summer and winter. It was first used in 1908 in Canada and later adopted by Germany and Austria-Hungary in 1916. The idea came from ancient societies and even Benjamin Franklin, but it wasn't widely used until the 1970s.",
