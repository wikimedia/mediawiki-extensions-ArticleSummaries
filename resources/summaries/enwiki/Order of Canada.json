	"summary": "The Order of Canada is a big deal in Canada, second only to the Order of Merit. It's like a special club that honors people who've done amazing things for the country or made the world a better place. Started in 1967, it has three levels: Companion, Officer, and Member. Even non-Canadians can get this honor. The current king, Charles III, is the head of this order, and the governor general helps run it. Over 8,000 people have gotten this award, including famous scientists, musicians, and athletes. They get a cool badge and an official coat of arms.",
