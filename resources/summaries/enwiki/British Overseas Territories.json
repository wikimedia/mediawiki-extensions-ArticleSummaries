	"summary": "The British Overseas Territories (BOTs) are 14 places around the world that are still connected to the UK. They have their own local governments but the UK is in charge of big things like defense, international relations, and keeping everyone safe. Three of these territories are mainly home to military or scientists, while the rest have many civilians. All of them have the UK's king or queen as their head of state. The UK's Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office looks after these territories.",
