	"summary": "Tornadoes are nature's powerful whirlwinds, forming when air rotates violently. They connect the earth to storm clouds, often looking like a funnel. These twisters can vary in size and speed, from gentle to incredibly strong. The strongest ones can reach over 480 km/h!\n\nYou'll mostly find them in North America, especially in a place called Tornado Alley. Other places like South Africa, Europe, and parts of Asia also experience tornadoes. Meteorologists use special radar and spotters to track and predict these fascinating, yet dangerous, weather events.",
