	"summary": "Outer space is the vast area beyond Earth's atmosphere, filled with a near-vacuum and various forms of radiation. It allows us to see distant galaxies, like in the Webb Telescope's first image. Space contains extremely low densities of hydrogen and helium, with a very cold temperature of about -455°F. The matter between galaxies is mostly hydrogen plasma, very spread out.\n\nThe Kármán line, 62 miles above sea level, marks the beginning of space. International laws allow all countries to explore it freely. Humans have sent crewed missions to low Earth orbit and the Moon, but the challenges of radiation and vacuum make exploring deeper space difficult.",
