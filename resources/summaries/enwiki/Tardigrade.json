	"summary": "Tardigrades, also known as water bears or moss piglets, are tiny eight-legged animals first described in 1773. They got their name \"slow steppers\" in 1776. Found in various places like mountaintops, deep sea, and Antarctica, they are incredibly tough, surviving extreme conditions and even outer space. There are about 1,300 known species, dating back to the Cretaceous period. They are about 0.5 mm long, with claws or suction disks on their legs. Tardigrades live in moss and lichens, feeding on plants and small animals. They are easy to observe under a microscope.",
