It is associated with New Zealand, which helps with its defense, but the Cook Islands govern themselves and have their own foreign policy. The capital is Avarua, and most people live on the island of Rarotonga. Many Cook Islanders also live in New Zealand and Australia. Tourism is the country's most important industry, attracting over 168,000 visitors in 2018.",
