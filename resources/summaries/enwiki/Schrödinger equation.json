	"summary": "Schrödinger's equation is a math formula that helps us understand how things work in the tiny world of quantum mechanics. It was created by a scientist named Erwin Schrödinger in the 1920s. This equation is like a tool that tells us how the \"wave function\" of a system changes over time. The wave function describes the behavior of small particles. Schrödinger's idea was based on the work of Louis de Broglie, who said that everything has a wave-like nature. This equation helped explain how atoms work and won Schrödinger a Nobel Prize.",
