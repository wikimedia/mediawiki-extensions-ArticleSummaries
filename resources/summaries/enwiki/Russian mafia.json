	"summary": "The Russian mafia, also known as \"bratva,\" is a group of organized crime elements from the former Soviet Union. They are often called \"Organized Criminal Groups\" (OCG). In 2012, there were around 6,000 such groups, with over 200 operating globally. These groups include ex-prisoners, corrupt officials, and people with shared ethnic or regional backgrounds. The Russian mafia is well-structured, like the Italian mafia, but benefited from post-Soviet political corruption and easy access to weapons, allowing them to expand and even include government officials. They are involved in various illegal activities, including uranium trading and human trafficking.",
