The capital is Barcelona, a very populous city in the EU. \n\nIn the past, it was part of the Crown of Aragon and had its own government and laws. Over time, it went through various political changes, including a brief republic and a period under Franco's dictatorship, where Catalan autonomy was suppressed. \n\nIn recent years, there's been a strong movement for independence, leading to a declared independence in 2017, which Spain didn't recognize. Since then, support for independence has fluctuated.",
