	"summary": "The Crusades were religious wars led by the Christian Church in the Middle Ages. They started in 1095 when Pope Urban II asked for help from Europe to take back Jerusalem from Muslim control. Many people from different social classes joined, hoping for religious salvation, adventure, or power. The first Crusade succeeded in capturing Jerusalem in 1099. Over time, more campaigns were launched, sometimes led by kings, against Muslims, other Christians, and pagans. These wars continued for centuries, with mixed results, until the 15th century. Some Crusades, like the Children's Crusade, were not officially supported by the Church.",
