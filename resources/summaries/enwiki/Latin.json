	"summary": "Latin is an ancient language from Italy, spoken by the Latins in the region around Rome. It became the main language of the Roman Empire and was used for important writing and communication in Europe for many centuries. Over time, it developed into different forms, including Classical Latin and Vulgar Latin, which later turned into the Romance languages like Italian and French.\n\nLatin has complex grammar and its own alphabet, which came from the Etruscans and Greeks. Even though it's not spoken as a native language anymore, Latin is still used in some special places, like the Catholic Church. It has also given many words to English and other languages, especially in science, medicine, and law.",
