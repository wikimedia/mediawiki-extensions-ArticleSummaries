	"summary": "Valinor, meaning \"Land of the Valar,\" is a place in J.R.R. Tolkien's stories, located far west of Middle-earth. It's the home of immortal beings called the Valar and some Elves. This realm is also known as the Blessed Realm and the Undying Lands, though it doesn't make mortals live forever.\n\nOnly immortals typically live there, but a few exceptions, like Bilbo and Frodo Baggins, were allowed to stay for a while. The story of NÃºmenor's attempt to conquer Aman is compared to biblical and Greek myths. The beautiful Elvish lands in Valinor are similar to tales from the Middle Ages.",
