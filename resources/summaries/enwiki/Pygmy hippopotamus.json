	"summary": "## Pygmy Hippopotamuses: Tiny Water-Loving Giants\n\nPygmy hippos are small, rare animals native to West Africa's forests and swamps. They're related to the larger common hippopotamus but prefer to live alone and are active at night. They need water to keep cool and moist, often mating and giving birth there. They eat plants like ferns and fruits found in the forest.\n\nOnce unknown outside Africa, they now live in zoos worldwide. While they breed well in captivity, fewer than 2,500 are left in the wild due to habitat loss, hunting, and war.",
