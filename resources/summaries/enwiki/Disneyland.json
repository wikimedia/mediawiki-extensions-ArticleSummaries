He chose a larger site near Anaheim after realizing his original idea was too small. The park opened in 1955 and has since become a world-famous destination.\n\nDesigned by a talented team, Disneyland has expanded with new areas like New Orleans Square and Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge. It's one of the most popular theme parks globally, attracting millions of visitors each year and creating many jobs in the process.",
