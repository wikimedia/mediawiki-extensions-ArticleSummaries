	"summary": "The Eucharist, also called Holy Communion, is a special Christian ceremony. It involves eating bread and drinking wine (or grape juice) to remember Jesus' last meal with his disciples. Christians believe Jesus' body and blood are somehow present in these elements.\n\nDifferent churches have different ideas about how this happens. Some believe the bread and wine change into Jesus' body and blood, while others think he is present spiritually. This difference of opinion has been a big topic in discussions between different Christian groups.",
