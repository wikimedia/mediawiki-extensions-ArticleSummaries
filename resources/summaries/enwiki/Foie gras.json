	"summary": "Foie gras is a fancy food made from the big, fat livers of ducks or geese. It's a French delicacy, known for its rich, buttery taste. To make it, farmers force-feed the birds to make their livers grow really big. This process is called gavage, and it's been around since ancient Egypt. France is the biggest maker and eater of foie gras, but it's also popular in many other countries. However, some people think this practice is cruel to animals, and some countries have banned it.",
