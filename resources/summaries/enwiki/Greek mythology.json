These tales explain the world's beginnings, the gods' lives, and important Greek rituals. They were first shared through songs and poems, with famous works like Homer's *Iliad* and *Odyssey*, and Hesiod's *Theogony*. These stories were also shown in art on vases and other objects. Greek mythology has greatly influenced Western culture and is still important in our language and arts today.",
