	"summary": "Tourette Syndrome (TS) is a common brain-related disorder that starts in childhood. It causes people to have sudden, uncontrollable movements (like blinking or facial twitches) and sounds (like coughing or saying words). These are called tics. Most people with TS have mild symptoms, and many don't even notice them. It's more common than people think, affecting about 1 in 100 kids. There's no cure, but most don't need medicine. Learning about it and understanding the tics often helps.",
