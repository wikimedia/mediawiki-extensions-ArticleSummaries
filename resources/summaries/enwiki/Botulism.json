This can lead to muscle weakness all over the body, as well as stomach problems.\n\nYou can get botulism from eating contaminated food, it can grow in a baby's gut, or enter through a wound. It's not spread between people.\n\nPrevention includes safe food handling and not giving honey to babies. Treatment uses an antitoxin and sometimes a breathing machine. With care, most people recover.",
