	"summary": "\"The Fallen Angel\" by Alexandre Cabanel depicts Lucifer, often linked to the Devil in Christian belief. Originally, Lucifer meant \"morning star\" or \"light-bringer\" in Latin, translating the Hebrew word for \"Shining One.\" Over time, this term was used to describe the planet Venus and was even personified as a god. The Bible's King James Version used \"Lucifer\" to refer to the Devil, but modern scholars often translate it back to its original meaning of \"morning star\" in certain passages.",
