	"summary": "A **genus** is a group of related species that are classified together. It's a level in the way scientists organize living things, between **species** (the most specific group) and **family** (a larger group). The first part of a species' scientific name is always the genus it belongs to. For example, *Panthera leo* (lion) and *Panthera onca* (jaguar) are in the genus *Panthera*. Taxonomists decide which species go together in a genus, but there aren't strict rules, so different scientists might classify genera differently.",
