	"summary": "Petra, an ancient city in Jordan, is a wonder of the world. Carved into colorful sandstone, it's also known as the \"Rose City.\" The Nabataeans, an Arab tribe, made it their capital around 200 BC. They were experts in trading, farming, and water management, making Petra a thriving center. Its most famous building, Al-Khazneh, might be a king's tomb.\n\nPetra was taken over by the Romans in 106 AD and later declined due to earthquakes and changing trade routes. Rediscovered in 1812, it's now Jordan's top tourist attraction, with over a million visitors in 2019.",
