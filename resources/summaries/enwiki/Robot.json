	"summary": "A robot is a machine that can do tasks automatically, often with the help of computers. They can be controlled remotely or have built-in intelligence. Robots come in various forms, like humanoids (like Honda's ASIMO) or industrial machines. They can work in dangerous places, perform repetitive jobs, or even resemble living things.\n\nThe word \"robot\" comes from a Czech play in 1920. Early robots were simple automated devices, but modern robots are advanced, with some having artificial intelligence. They are used in many fields, from manufacturing to healthcare, and raise questions about their impact on jobs and society.",
