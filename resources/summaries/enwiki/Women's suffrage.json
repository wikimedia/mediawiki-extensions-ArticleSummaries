	"summary": "Women's suffrage means women have the right to vote in elections. In the 1700s, people started fighting for this right. Political parties and organizations worldwide worked to make it happen.\n\nSome places gave women the vote early, like the Pitcairn Islands in 1838 and New Zealand in 1893. After World War I, many countries followed, including Canada, Germany, and the UK. A few places, like France and Switzerland, took longer.\n\nWomen's contributions during the wars helped change people's minds about why they should vote. It was argued that if women could work in factories, they could also make political decisions.",
