	"summary": "Wasps are insects that belong to the Hymenoptera order, excluding bees and ants. They are diverse, with over 100,000 species, and can be social or solitary. Some common wasps, like yellowjackets, live in colonies with a queen. Wasps can be predators, pollinators, or parasitoids, laying eggs on or in other insects. They have a long history, dating back to the Jurassic period, and are found worldwide except at the poles. Wasps vary in size, from tiny parasitoids to the large Asian giant hornet. They have cultural significance, appearing in literature and inspiring military names.",
