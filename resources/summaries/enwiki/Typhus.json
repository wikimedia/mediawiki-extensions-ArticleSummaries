	"summary": "Typhus is a group of diseases caused by bacteria. There are three main types: epidemic typhus (spread by lice), scrub typhus (spread by chiggers), and murine typhus (spread by fleas). Symptoms include fever, headache, and a rash. Currently, no vaccines are available, but prevention involves avoiding the creatures that carry the bacteria. Treatment uses an antibiotic called doxycycline. Typhus has been known since the 16th century, and its name comes from a Greek word meaning \"hazy\" or \"smoky,\" describing the infected person's mental state.",
