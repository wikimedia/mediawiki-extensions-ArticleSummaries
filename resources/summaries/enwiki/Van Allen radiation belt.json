	"summary": "## Van Allen Belts: Earth's Protective Shield\n\nEarth has two main Van Allen belts, named after scientist James Van Allen. These belts are like invisible shields made of charged particles, mostly from the sun. They protect our planet by trapping these particles, preventing them from harming the atmosphere.\n\nThe belts are shaped like donuts around Earth, starting about 400 miles above its surface and extending to 36,000 miles. Satellites need special protection when traveling through these belts due to high radiation levels.\n\nSometimes, a third, temporary belt can form. Scientists continue to study these fascinating natural phenomena.",
