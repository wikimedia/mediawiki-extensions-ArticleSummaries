	"summary": "The Old Testament is the first part of the Christian Bible, mostly based on the Hebrew Bible's 24 books. It's divided into four parts: the Pentateuch (first five books), history books, wisdom books, and the prophets' books. These books were written over many years by different authors.\n\nChristian churches have slightly different lists of Old Testament books. Some have more books, like the Eastern Orthodox Church, while Protestants have fewer. The differences mainly come from ancient translations and Jewish traditions.",
