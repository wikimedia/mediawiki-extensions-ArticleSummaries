	"summary": "Measles is a very contagious disease caused by a virus. It can lead to fever, cough, and a rash. You can get it from being near someone who's infected, like through their cough or sneeze. It's super contagious, and if you're not immune, you'll likely get it if you're around someone who has it.\n\nThere's good news though! There's a vaccine that can prevent measles. It's safe and works really well. Thanks to this vaccine, many lives have been saved, especially in kids under five, who are more at risk.",
