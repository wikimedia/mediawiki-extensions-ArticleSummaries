	"summary": "Gentrification happens when richer people move into a neighborhood, changing its character. This often happens in cities where there aren't enough homes, and house prices are going up. It can make the area more valuable but also causes controversy.\n\nThe process starts when wealthier people move in, then investors and developers follow, improving the area. This can lead to higher rents, which might force some original residents to leave. It's a complex issue, as it brings benefits like better infrastructure and lower crime but can also cause social changes and displacement.",
