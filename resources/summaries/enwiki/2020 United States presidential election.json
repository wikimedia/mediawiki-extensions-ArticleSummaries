	"summary": "The 2020 US presidential election was held on November 3, 2020, with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris winning against incumbent president Donald Trump and vice president Mike Pence. This election had the highest voter turnout since 1900, with Biden receiving a record-breaking 81 million votes. Biden secured the Democratic nomination over Bernie Sanders, while Trump won the Republican nomination. The election was influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, civil unrest, and Supreme Court appointments. Mail-in ballots were popular due to the pandemic, and Biden ultimately won with 306 electoral votes, becoming the first Democrat to win Georgia and Arizona since 1992 and 1996, respectively. Trump refused to concede and attempted to overturn the results, leading to a mob attacking the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. Biden and Harris were inaugurated on January 20, 2021.",
