	"summary": "Katy Perry's album \"143\" came out in 2024, her first since \"Smile\" (2020). It's about self-love and empowerment, inspired by her becoming a mom. She worked with old collaborators like Max Martin and new ones like Vaughn Oliver. The album title means \"I love you\" and is her \"angel number.\" It got negative reviews, with critics saying it felt uncreative and outdated. Three singles came out before the album: \"Woman's World,\" \"Lifetimes,\" and \"I'm His, He's Mine.\" The album reached top ten in many countries. Perry will tour in 2025 to promote it.",
