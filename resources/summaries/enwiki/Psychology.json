It covers a huge range of topics, from understanding our brains to why we do certain things in groups. Psychologists can be researchers, therapists, or work in schools, businesses, or hospitals. They help us understand why we tick and how to make our minds and lives healthier. It's all about figuring out the mysteries of the mind and using that to make the world a better place.",
