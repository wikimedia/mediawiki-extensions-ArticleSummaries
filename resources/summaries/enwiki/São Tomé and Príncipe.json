With around 200,000 people, it's one of Africa's smallest countries. It was a key trading center for slaves and later became known for its sugar, coffee, and cocoa. It gained independence from Portugal in 1975 and is now a stable, democratic country. Most people there are of African or mixed descent and are Christian, with Portuguese influences in their culture.",
