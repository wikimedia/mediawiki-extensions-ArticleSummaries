The numbers a, b, and c are called coefficients.\n\nThese equations have up to two solutions, called \"roots\".  Sometimes, the roots are real numbers, and sometimes they're imaginary (\"complex\") numbers. You can find the roots using a formula called the \"quadratic formula\".\n\nPeople have been solving quadratic equations for thousands of years!",
