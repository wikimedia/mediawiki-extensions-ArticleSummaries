	"summary": "The Great Lakes are a group of five large freshwater lakes in North America, shared by the United States and Canada. They are Lake Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie, and Ontario. These lakes are huge, containing 21% of the world's surface fresh water. They were formed around 14,000 years ago as ice sheets retreated after the last ice age. The Great Lakes are important for transportation, trade, and fishing, and support many cities around their shores, like Chicago, Detroit, and Toronto.",
