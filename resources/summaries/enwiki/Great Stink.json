	"summary": "In 1858, London experienced the Great Stink, a terrible smell from the River Thames due to raw sewage and waste. This problem caused diseases like cholera. Joseph Bazalgette, an engineer, proposed a solution: new sewers to move the waste away from the city. His plan, which took 16 years to complete, created three embankments (Victoria, Chelsea, and Albert) with sewers inside. This project saved lives and stopped cholera outbreaks. Today, Bazalgette's sewer system still works, serving London's millions of residents, and he is considered a hero.",
