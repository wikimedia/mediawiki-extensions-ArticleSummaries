	"summary": "General relativity is a scientific theory by Albert Einstein that explains how gravity works. It shows that space and time are connected and form a four-dimensional structure called spacetime. Massive objects like stars curve spacetime, affecting the movement of other objects and even light. This theory led to the discovery of black holes, where gravity is so strong that nothing can escape. It also explains phenomena like gravitational waves, which were later observed by scientists. General relativity is considered beautiful and elegant, agreeing with all experiments so far.",
