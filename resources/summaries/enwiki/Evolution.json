	"summary": "Evolution is how living things change over time. It happens when traits that help an organism survive become more common in a population. This process was first described by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace. They noticed that organisms produce more offspring than can survive, and those with helpful traits are more likely to pass them on.\n\nModern evolutionary theory combines Darwin's ideas with genetics. It explains how DNA carries information about traits and how changes in DNA lead to evolution. Evolution has led to the diversity of life we see today, from simple cells to complex animals.",
