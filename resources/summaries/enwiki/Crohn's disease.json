It's not clear what causes it, but it might be a mix of genes, environment, and immune issues. Symptoms include tummy pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. It can also cause skin rashes, tiredness, and other health problems outside the gut.\n\nThere's no cure, but medicine like steroids and other drugs can help control the symptoms. Quitting smoking is also important. Sometimes, surgery is needed for serious cases or complications like blockages. It's more common in Europe and North America, and it usually starts in teens or young adults.",
