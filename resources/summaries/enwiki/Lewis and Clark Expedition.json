They traveled from Illinois up the Missouri River, crossed the Continental Divide, and reached the Pacific Ocean in 1805. The journey aimed to map the new territory, find a route to the ocean, and establish American presence before Europeans. They also studied nature, geography, and traded with Native American tribes.
