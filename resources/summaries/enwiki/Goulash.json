	"summary": "Goulash is a tasty Hungarian dish, like a soup or stew, made with meat, veggies, and spices. It's super popular in Central Europe and is one of Hungary's national dishes. The history of goulash goes way back to the 10th century when Hungarian shepherds made it with dried, flavored meat. They'd store it in sheep stomach bags and just add water to cook it. Back then, paprika wasn't used; it was only introduced later in the 16th century.",
