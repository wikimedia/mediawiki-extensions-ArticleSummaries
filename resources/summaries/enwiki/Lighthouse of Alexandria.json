	"summary": "The Lighthouse of Alexandria, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, was built around 280â€“247 BC by the Ptolemaic Kingdom. It was over 300 feet tall and one of the tallest structures of its time. Earthquakes damaged it between 956 and 1323 AD, and its stones were later used to build the Citadel of Qaitbay. In 1994, archaeologists found remains of the lighthouse underwater. Egypt plans to turn these ruins into an underwater museum.",
