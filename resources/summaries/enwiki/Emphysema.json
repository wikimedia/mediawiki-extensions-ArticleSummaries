	"summary": "Emphysema is a lung disease where the air sacs (alveoli) get bigger and break down, making it hard for your lungs to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide properly. This leads to breathing problems. It's often caused by smoking and can happen with other conditions like Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. There are four types, and some are more likely to cause serious breathing issues. Emphysema can also increase the risk of other health problems like osteoporosis. It's important to see a doctor if you have symptoms like trouble breathing or a cough that won't go away.",
