	"summary": "The missionary position is a common sex position where a woman lies on her back and a man lies on top of her, facing each other. It's often used by heterosexual couples and allows for skin-to-skin contact, eye-to-eye gazing, and kissing. The man has more control over the rhythm and depth of thrusting, but the woman can also move her hips and use her arms and legs to adjust the position. While it's popular, it may not be the most favored for everyone, especially if the woman wants more control. It's also not recommended during late pregnancy.",
