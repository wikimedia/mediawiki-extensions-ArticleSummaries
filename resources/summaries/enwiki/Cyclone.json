	"summary": "Cyclones are huge air masses that spin around a low-pressure center. They can be found on Earth and even on other planets! In the Northern Hemisphere, they spin counterclockwise, while in the Southern Hemisphere, they spin clockwise.\n\nThere are different types, like tropical cyclones (hurricanes or typhoons) and extratropical cyclones. These storms form when warm and cold air masses meet, creating weather fronts. Cyclones can cause thunderstorms, fog, and sometimes severe weather. They get their energy from the heat of the ocean and can grow stronger as they spin.",
