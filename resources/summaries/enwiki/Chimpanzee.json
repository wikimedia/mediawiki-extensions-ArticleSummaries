	"summary": "Chimpanzees, or chimps, are great apes found in tropical Africa. They are our closest living relatives, sharing a close evolutionary history with humans. Chimps have black hair and bare faces and hands. They live in large groups and use tools for various tasks, showing remarkable intelligence.\n\nThese social animals have a complex hierarchy and rarely resort to violence. Unfortunately, they are endangered due to habitat loss, poaching, and disease. Chimps are often depicted in popular culture but are not suitable as pets due to their strength and unpredictable nature.",
