	"summary": "Asperger syndrome (AS), once a diagnosis for people with social and communication challenges, is now part of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). People with AS may struggle to understand others' feelings, have limited interests, and repeat certain behaviors. It was named after Hans Asperger, who first described these traits.\n\nWe don't fully understand what causes AS, but it runs in families and might be linked to environment. There's no cure; instead, support and training help people with AS manage their daily lives. This might include social skills classes or therapy. AS affects about 0.5% of people worldwide, more often males than females. It's now diagnosed as part of ASD.",
