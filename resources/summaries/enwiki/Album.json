	"summary": "An album is a collection of songs or music released together. Originally, albums were books with multiple 78 rpm records, but they evolved into vinyl records played at 33 rpm. In the 2000s, albums were mostly released on CDs or as digital files. Albums can be recorded in studios, concert venues, or other locations, and the process can take from hours to years. Album covers and liner notes provide additional information about the music. The term \"album\" comes from book collections and was later used for music collections on different formats like vinyl, CDs, and digital files.",
