	"summary": "Sodium hypochlorite, often known as bleach, is a common household chemical. It's a greenish-yellow liquid used as a disinfectant and to make things white (bleach). It's made of sodium and hypochlorite ions. Be careful with bleach because it's unstable and can release harmful chlorine gas if mixed with certain other cleaning products. This gas was even used as a weapon in World War I. Mixing bleach with ammonia doesn't make chlorine, but it can create other dangerous chemicals.",
