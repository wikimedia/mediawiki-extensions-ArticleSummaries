	"summary": "\"The Last Supper\" is a famous wall painting by Leonardo da Vinci, created around 1495-1498 in Milan, Italy. It shows Jesus and his 12 apostles during their final meal together, when Jesus reveals that one of them will betray him. The painting is special because it shows great skill in how the figures are spaced, their emotions, and how it looks like they are moving. Despite some damage over time, it remains one of Leonardo's most famous works and a symbol of the High Renaissance.",
