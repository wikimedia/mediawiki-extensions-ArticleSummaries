These patterns start early in life and can cause problems in many areas, like thinking, emotions, and relationships. They can be hard to change and might make daily life difficult.\n\nDoctors use books like the *Diagnostic and Statistical Manual* to identify these disorders, but there are different ideas about how to define and diagnose them. Treatment often involves therapy to help people manage their symptoms and improve their lives.",
