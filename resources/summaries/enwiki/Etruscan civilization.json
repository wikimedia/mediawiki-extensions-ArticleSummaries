	"summary": "The Etruscans were an ancient people who lived in Italy and created a unique civilization. They spoke their own language and had a rich culture. At its peak, their territory covered parts of modern-day Tuscany, Umbria, and Lazio. The Etruscans were skilled traders, connecting with the Celts and Greeks. They developed their own writing system, and their early inscriptions date back to 700 BC. Unfortunately, much of what we know about them comes from later Roman and Greek sources. The Roman Empire eventually absorbed Etruscan lands, granting them citizenship in 90 BC.",
