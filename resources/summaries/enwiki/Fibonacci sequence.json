	"summary": "The Fibonacci sequence is a pattern where each number is the sum of the two before it: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and so on. It's named after the Italian mathematician Fibonacci. This sequence is found in nature, like in pinecones and flowers, and also in math and computer science. The numbers can be calculated using a formula linked to the golden ratio. They are also connected to Lucas numbers, forming special math patterns.",
