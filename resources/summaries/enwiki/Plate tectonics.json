	"summary": "Earth's outer layer, called the lithosphere, is like a giant jigsaw puzzle with 7 to 8 main pieces called tectonic plates. These plates have been moving slowly for billions of years, shaping our planet. They move due to heat from Earth's core, creating different types of boundaries where they meet:\n- **Divergent:** Plates move apart, creating new crust.\n- **Convergent:** Plates collide, one might go under (subduction), forming mountains or deep ocean trenches.\n- **Transform:** Plates slide past each other, causing earthquakes.\n\nThis movement is why we have earthquakes, volcanoes, and mountains. It's like Earth is a giant, slow-moving conveyor belt!",
