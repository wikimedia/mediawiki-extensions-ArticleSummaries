	"summary": "The Laysan honeycreeper, a small bright red bird, lived only on Laysan Island in Hawaii. It had a short, downturned bill and ate nectar and insects, even foraging on the ground.  Though active, it was rare even before rabbits were introduced in 1903, which destroyed the island's plants. By 1923, the honeycreeper was extinct, unable to survive the barren conditions caused by the rabbits.",
