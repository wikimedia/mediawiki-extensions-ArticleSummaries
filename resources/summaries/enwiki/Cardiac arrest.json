	"summary": "Cardiac arrest is when your heart stops beating suddenly, causing a lack of blood flow to your body and brain. This can make you lose consciousness and might lead to a coma. It's often due to irregular heart rhythms, especially in people with heart disease or older adults.\n\nIf someone has no pulse, they are likely experiencing cardiac arrest. Treatment includes CPR, defibrillation, and getting the heart back to a normal rhythm. Quick action is crucial to save lives.\n\nIn the US, over 500,000 people face cardiac arrest yearly, with most happening outside hospitals. It's more common in men and older people, and Black individuals have a higher risk of death from it.",
