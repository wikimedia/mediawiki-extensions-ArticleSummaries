	"summary": "## Simplifying Reynolds Numbers\n\nThe Reynolds number is a tool used in fluid dynamics (how fluids move) to predict if a fluid will flow smoothly (laminar) or chaotically (turbulent). It's like measuring how fast a river is flowing and how bumpy its surface is.\n\nOsborne Reynolds made this concept popular. The Reynolds number helps engineers design things like airplanes and pipes by predicting when flow will turn turbulent, which can be bad for efficiency. It's used in many areas, from studying weather patterns to designing better ships.",
