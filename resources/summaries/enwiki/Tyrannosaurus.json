	"summary": "Tyrannosaurus rex, often called T. rex, was a massive meat-eating dinosaur that lived about 73-66 million years ago. It was one of the last non-bird dinosaurs before they went extinct. T. rex had a huge head, powerful jaws, and tiny front limbs with claws. It was a top predator, hunting hadrosaurs and other large dinosaurs. Some scientists think it might have also scavenged dead animals.\n\nT. rex fossils are common in North America, and we've learned a lot about its biology. It grew up to 40 feet long and weighed about 9 tons. Its strong bite was the largest of any land animal. T. rex's image is famous and appears in movies, books, and many other places.",
