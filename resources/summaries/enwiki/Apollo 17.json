They aimed to collect old lunar rock samples and study possible recent volcanic activity. The team landed at Taurus-Littrow, finding volcanic \"orange soil.\" Schmitt, a geologist, was the first scientist to walk on the moon.\n\nThis mission set records: longest lunar mission (12 days), farthest distance during a spacewalk (4.7 miles), and most lunar samples returned (254 lbs). It was a significant scientific achievement, marking the last human journey beyond low Earth orbit.",
