	"summary": "Sufism is a spiritual path within Islam, focusing on purification and connecting with God. Sufis, the practitioners, aim to reach a pure state, called *fitra*, and please God. This tradition began in early Islamic times, led by teachers like Hasan al-Basri. Sufis follow Islamic laws but also emphasize spirituality and self-discipline. They often belong to groups called *tariqa*, led by a master. Sufism has spread Islam and influenced Western spirituality, despite facing opposition from some modern Islamic groups.",
