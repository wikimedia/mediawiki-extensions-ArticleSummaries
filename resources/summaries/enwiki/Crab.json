	"summary": "Crabs are animals from the sea, rivers, and land. They belong to a group called Brachyura, which means \"short tail\" in Greek. Their tails are small and hidden under their bodies. Crabs have a hard outer shell, called an exoskeleton, and one pair of pincers on each arm. These creatures have been around for a very long time, starting from the Jurassic period, about 200 million years ago. You can find them in oceans, freshwater, and even on land.",
