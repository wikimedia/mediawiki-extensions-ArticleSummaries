	"summary": "Life is what sets apart things that can grow, move, and change from those that cannot. It's found in air, water, and soil all over Earth. All living things need to maintain balance, respond to their environment, and reproduce. They are made up of tiny building blocks called cells, and special molecules like DNA and proteins. Life has been around for over 3.5 billion years and has evolved into many different species. Scientists still debate what exactly defines life, especially when it comes to things like viruses.",
