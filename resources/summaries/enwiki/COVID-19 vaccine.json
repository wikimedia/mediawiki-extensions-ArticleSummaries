	"summary": "COVID-19 vaccines help your body fight the virus. They use different methods, like RNA or viral vectors, to teach your immune system to recognize and fight the virus. After getting the vaccine, your body makes a protein found in the virus, which triggers your immune system to create antibodies. These antibodies protect you if you come across the real virus.\n\nThe vaccines were made quickly because scientists already knew about similar viruses. They've been very effective, preventing many deaths and illnesses. Most people get two doses, and it's safe for everyone, including pregnant women. Over 13 billion doses have been given worldwide.",
