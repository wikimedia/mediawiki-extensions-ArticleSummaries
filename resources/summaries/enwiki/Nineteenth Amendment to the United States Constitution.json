	"summary": "The Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution gave women the right to vote in 1920. This was a big win after many years of fighting for women's suffrage. Women had once voted in some American colonies but lost that right by 1807. The amendment was first suggested in 1878 but didn't pass until 1919. It was needed because not all states allowed women to vote. Famous activists like Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton fought for this right. After World War I, public opinion changed, and President Wilson supported it. The amendment was officially adopted on August 26, 1920.",
