	"summary": "Software is like a set of instructions that tell computers what to do. It's written in special languages, like JavaScript. The history of software started with simple machine codes and evolved to easier-to-read languages. Now, we have complex software for various tasks.\n\nThere are two main types: system software (like operating systems) and application software (like games or word processors). Recently, a new way to get software called SaaS (Software as a Service) has become popular, where you access programs over the internet.\n\nCreating software involves designing, coding, testing, and maintaining it, while also ensuring it's secure and works well.",
