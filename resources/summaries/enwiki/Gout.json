	"summary": "Gout is a type of arthritis that causes painful, swollen joints, usually in the big toe. It's caused by sharp uric acid crystals building up in the joint. This can happen due to certain foods, like liver or shellfish, or if you're overweight. Gout attacks come on quickly, but can be treated with medicine to reduce the pain and swelling. Eating less of these trigger foods and taking medicine daily can help prevent future attacks. Gout is common, especially in older men.",
