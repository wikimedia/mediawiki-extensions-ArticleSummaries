	"summary": "The Mexican Revolution was a civil war that lasted about a decade. It started because people were unhappy with the president, Porfirio Díaz, and his rule. Francisco Madero led the first rebellion, which began in 1910. After Díaz resigned, Madero became president but faced more rebellions. A general named Victoriano Huerta took over in 1913 and ruled until 1914.\n\nThe revolution continued with different groups fighting. Venustiano Carranza's army won in 1915, and a new constitution was made in 1917, bringing changes like land reform and more power to the government. Revolutionary generals ruled Mexico until 1940. This time was important as it led to a new political party, the PRI, which governed Mexico for many years.",
