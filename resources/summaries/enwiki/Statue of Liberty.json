	"summary": "The Statue of Liberty is a giant statue in New York City, given to the United States by France. It was designed by Frédéric Bartholdi and built with help from Gustave Eiffel. The statue shows a woman holding a torch, symbolizing freedom and the U.S. The idea came from Édouard de Laboulaye to celebrate U.S. independence and the end of slavery. It was funded by France and the U.S., with help from a newspaper campaign. The statue was assembled on an island and dedicated in 1886. Now, it's a famous tourist spot, though only a few can go inside.",
