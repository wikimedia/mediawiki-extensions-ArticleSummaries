	"summary": "Baseball is a team sport played with a bat and ball. Two teams of nine players take turns batting and fielding. The batter tries to hit the ball thrown by the pitcher and then run around four bases to score runs. Fielders try to stop this by catching the ball or tagging the runners. A game has nine innings, and each team gets a turn to bat. The team with the most runs at the end wins. Baseball is popular in North America, Central and South America, the Caribbean, and East Asia. It has been played in the Olympics and has its own World Series competition.",
