	"summary": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a gut problem that causes belly pain, bloating, and changes in poop. It can last for years and affect your daily life. We don't know the exact cause, but stress, gut issues, or food might play a role. Doctors diagnose IBS by checking your symptoms and ruling out other diseases.\n\nTreatment includes eating more fiber or following a special diet, taking medicine for diarrhea or constipation, and sometimes using antidepressants. Talking to a counselor can also help. About 1 in 10 people worldwide have IBS, more commonly women in the West. It doesn't shorten your life, but it can be uncomfortable.",
