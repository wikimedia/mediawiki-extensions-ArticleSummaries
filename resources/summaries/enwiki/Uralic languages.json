These languages have unique features like complex grammar cases and vowel harmony. The name comes from the Ural Mountains, where they are believed to have originated. Some people use the term \"Finno-Ugric\" instead, but this usually excludes the Samoyedic languages. These languages are part of a larger family with a shared history.",
