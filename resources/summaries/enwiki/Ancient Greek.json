	"summary": "Ancient Greek was spoken from 1500 BC to 300 BC. It's divided into four periods: Mycenaean, Dark Ages, Archaic (or Epic), and Classical. Homer, famous for the *Odyssey*, and many Athenian writers used this language. It's an important part of English vocabulary and has been studied widely.\n\nThe Epic and Classical periods are well-known and often considered typical of Ancient Greek. After this, the language evolved into Koine Greek, which is different but similar to the earliest form of Koine. There were also different regional dialects.",
