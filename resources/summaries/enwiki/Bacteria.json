	"summary": "Bacteria are tiny, single-celled organisms found everywhere on Earth. They are essential for nature, helping to recycle nutrients and produce food. Some live in extreme places like hot springs or deep underground. They can also live inside plants and animals, sometimes causing diseases like cholera or the plague.\n\nBacteria are so small that many can't be seen without a microscope. They don't have a nucleus like our cells, which is why they are called \"prokaryotes.\" Scientists used to think all prokaryotes were bacteria, but now they know there's another group called Archaea.",
