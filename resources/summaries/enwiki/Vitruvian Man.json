	"summary": "The Vitruvian Man is a famous drawing by Leonardo da Vinci from around 1490. It shows a naked man in two poses, fitting inside a circle and square. This drawing is super important in art history because it combines art and science. Leonardo was inspired by an ancient Roman architect named Vitruvius, who wrote about ideal body proportions. The drawing is now in a museum in Venice, Italy, and doesn't go on display often because it's very sensitive to light.",
