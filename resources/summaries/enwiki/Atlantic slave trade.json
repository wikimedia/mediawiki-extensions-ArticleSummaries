	"summary": "The transatlantic slave trade was when European traders took African people as slaves and brought them to the Americas. This started in the 16th century and lasted until the 19th century. Most slaves were captured in Africa and sold to European traders by local African leaders. The slaves were then transported across the Atlantic Ocean in ships. They were treated as cargo and many died during the long journey.\n\nThese slaves worked on plantations and in mines, mainly in the Caribbean and South Atlantic. The trade was very profitable, but it caused great suffering. Many countries have since apologized for their role in this dark part of history.",
