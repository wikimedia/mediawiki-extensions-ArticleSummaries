	"summary": "Hiragana is a Japanese writing system used with kanji and katakana. It's a simple way to write Japanese words and sounds, using symbols for each syllable. These symbols are called \"kana.\" Hiragana is used for grammar words, verb endings, and when kanji isn't available. It's like an alphabet but for syllables, making it unique! There are two ways to organize these symbols: iroha and gojÅ«on.",
