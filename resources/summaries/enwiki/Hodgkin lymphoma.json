	"summary": "Hodgkin lymphoma is a cancer that starts in white blood cells called lymphocytes. It's named after Dr. Thomas Hodgkin, who discovered it. Symptoms include fever, night sweats, and swollen lymph nodes. People might feel tired or have an itchy skin rash.\n\nThere are two main types: classic and nodular lymphocyte-predominant. It can be caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Diagnosis is made by finding special cells called Reed-Sternberg cells in lymph node biopsies.\n\nTreatment includes chemotherapy, radiation, or stem cell transplants. With early detection, most people can be cured. It's more common in people aged 20-40.",
