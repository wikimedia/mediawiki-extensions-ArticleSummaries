	"summary": "The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is a small, British dog breed. They come in four colors: Blenheim (chestnut and white), tricolour (black, white, and tan), black and tan, and ruby. Their coat is smooth and silky. These dogs usually live for 8 to 12 years. The breed's look changed in the 1600s when they were crossed with flat-nosed dogs. In the 1920s, breeders tried to make them look like the spaniels from King Charles II's time.",
