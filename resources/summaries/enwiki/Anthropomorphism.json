	"summary": "Anthropomorphism is when we give human qualities to things that aren't human, like animals or objects. Personification is similar, but it gives human traits to abstract ideas, like the wind or emotions. These techniques have been used in stories and art for a long time. For example, in Aesop's fables, animals like the North Wind and the Sun act like people. This makes stories more interesting and helps us understand complex ideas.",
