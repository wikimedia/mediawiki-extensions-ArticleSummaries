	"summary": "The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, adopted in 1791, ensures several freedoms: religion, speech, press, assembly, and petitioning the government. It originally only applied to Congress but now covers all states. The amendment protects these rights from government interference, though not from all restrictions. For instance, commercial speech has less protection, and speech that causes harm isn't shielded. The Supreme Court has been key in expanding these rights through cases like Gitlow v. New York (1925) and New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964).",
