There are 18 clubs, each playing 34 games per season (home and away). The bottom two are relegated to the Eerste Divisie, while the top two from there are promoted. The third-last Eredivisie club plays a playoff. Ajax, PSV, and Feyenoord, known as the \"Big Three,\" have dominated, winning almost all titles since 1965. The league has had various sponsors, and in 2012, Rupert Murdoch secured rights for 12 years. The 2020 season was canceled due to COVID-19.",
