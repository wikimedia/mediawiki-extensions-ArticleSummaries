There are over 69,000 known species of vertebrates. They come in various sizes, from the tiny Paedophryne amauensis frog to the massive blue whale. Vertebrates make up a small part of all animal species, with most being invertebrates. Hagfish, though not having a traditional backbone, are also considered vertebrates due to their close relation to lampreys.",
