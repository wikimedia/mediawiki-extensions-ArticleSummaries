	"summary": "Chess is a strategy game played by two people on a special board. Each player has 16 pieces (like kings, queens, knights, and pawns) that move in different ways. The goal is to trap the other player's king, called \"checkmate.\" The rules of chess have evolved over many years and are now set by an international organization called FIDE. These rules cover how the pieces move, the equipment used, and how to play fairly. There are also rules for different types of chess games, like fast chess or online chess.",
