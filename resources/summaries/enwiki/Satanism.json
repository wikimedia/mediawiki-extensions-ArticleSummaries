	"summary": "The inverted pentagram is a symbol often linked to Satanism, a set of beliefs centered around Satan, sometimes tied to the Devil in Christianity. Satanism has a complex history, with accusations of \"devil worship\" thrown at various groups over centuries. Modern Satanism, however, is a recent development, starting with the Church of Satan founded in 1966 by Anton LaVey. This group doesn't believe in a supernatural Satan but uses the symbol to represent human traits. There are two main types of modern Satanists: those who worship Satan as a real entity, and atheistic Satanists who see Satan as a symbol.",
