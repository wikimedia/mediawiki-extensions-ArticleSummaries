	"summary": "The Illuminati was a secret society started in 1776 in what is now Germany. Its aim was to fight against ignorance and religious control. Led by Adam Weishaupt, they wanted to bring enlightenment and stop unfair rulers. However, they were banned by the local government and the Catholic Church in the late 1700s.\n\nOver time, the name \"Illuminati\" has been linked to different groups claimed to be behind world events, forming a secret global power. These ideas have spread widely in books, movies, and popular culture, even though there's no proof these groups exist.",
