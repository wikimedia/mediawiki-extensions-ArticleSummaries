	"summary": "A dwarf planet is a small space object that orbits the Sun directly. It's big enough to have a round shape due to its gravity but not big enough to control its orbit like the eight main planets. Pluto, once considered a planet, is the best-known dwarf planet. There are at least nine other large dwarf planets in our solar system, like Eris and Ceres. Some astronomers think there might be more, but it's not agreed upon yet. The term \"dwarf planet\" was suggested by scientist Alan Stern to categorize these objects in the solar system.",
