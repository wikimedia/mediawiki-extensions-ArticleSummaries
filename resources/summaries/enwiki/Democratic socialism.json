	"summary": "Democratic socialism is a political idea that combines democracy and socialism. It believes in a fair economy where workers have control, and everyone has an equal say. This means opposing capitalism, which democratic socialists think creates inequality.\n\nIt aims for a society with freedom, equality, and solidarity. Some democratic socialists want a slow change to this system, while others support more radical changes. This philosophy has its roots in 19th-century Europe and has many forms, including social democracy and libertarian socialism.",
