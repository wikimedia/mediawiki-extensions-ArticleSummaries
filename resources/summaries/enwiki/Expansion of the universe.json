	"summary": "The universe is getting bigger over time; this is called its expansion. It's like stretching a rubber band, but in all directions. Galaxies move apart, but those close to each other stay together due to gravity. This idea is important in understanding the Big Bang theory.\n\nA long time ago, the universe expanded really fast during a period called inflation. It's still expanding today, but much slower. Scientists think something called dark energy is making this happen. This expansion is like a rocket fuel pushing the universe to keep growing.",
