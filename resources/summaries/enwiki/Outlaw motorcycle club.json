	"summary": "An outlaw motorcycle club, or \"bikie club,\" is a group of motorcycle riders who share a love for freedom, nonconformity, and loyalty. They often ride cruiser bikes, like Harley-Davidsons. In the U.S., these clubs are called \"outlaw\" because they aren't part of the American Motorcyclist Association (AMA) and have their own rules. Some clubs, known as \"outlaw motorcycle gangs,\" are involved in criminal activities, as defined by the U.S. Department of Justice.",
