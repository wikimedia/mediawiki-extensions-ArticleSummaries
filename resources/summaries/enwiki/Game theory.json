	"summary": "Game theory is a way to study how people, animals, and computers make choices in situations where one's gain might be another's loss. It started with simple games where only two people played, and one person's win was the other's loss. John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern expanded this to more complex games with multiple players.\n\nOver time, game theory grew to be used in many areas like economics, logic, and computer science. It helps us understand how different beings make decisions, especially when there's uncertainty. Many experts have won big awards for their work in this field.",
