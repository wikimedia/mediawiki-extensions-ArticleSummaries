	"summary": "Dada was an art movement that started in 1915 during World War I. It was a group of artists who wanted to challenge traditional art and society's rules. They used weird and funny techniques like nonsense and irrationality to protest against war and capitalism.\n\nThe name 'Dada' might come from a French word for a toy horse or a child's first words, showing the group's playful and anti-establishment attitude. Artists like Marcel Duchamp and Francis Picabia were part of this movement, creating unique and thought-provoking works. Dada influenced many later art styles and inspired artists worldwide.",
