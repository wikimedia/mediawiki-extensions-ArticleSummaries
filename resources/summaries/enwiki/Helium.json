	"summary": "Helium is a chemical element with the symbol He and atomic number 2. It's a colorless, odorless, and non-toxic gas. Helium is the second lightest and most abundant element in the universe, found in stars and planets like the Sun and Jupiter. It has a very low boiling point and doesn't have a melting point at standard pressure.\n\nHelium was discovered in 1868 by scientists studying the Sun's spectrum during an eclipse. It was later found on Earth in uranium ore. Today, it's mostly extracted from natural gas.\n\nHelium has many uses, including in MRI scanners, balloons, and scientific research. It's also important in understanding quantum mechanics.",
