	"summary": "MRI is a special kind of medical scan that creates detailed images of the inside of your body. It uses powerful magnets, radio waves, and computers to make these pictures. Unlike X-rays, MRI doesn't use radiation, making it safer.\n\nThis technology is great for looking at soft tissues like your brain and organs. It helps doctors find diseases and see how they progress. However, some people might feel uncomfortable during the scan because they have to lie still inside a large machine. Also, metal objects in the body can't be scanned using MRI.",
