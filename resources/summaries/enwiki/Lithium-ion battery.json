	"summary": "Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are rechargeable batteries that store energy by moving lithium ions between layers of material. They are powerful and lightweight, with a high energy density, making them ideal for many modern devices. These batteries have revolutionized technology, powering laptops, phones, and even electric cars.\n\nFirst developed in the 1970s, Li-ion batteries have improved significantly. They are now more efficient, with a longer lifespan and faster charging. However, they can be unsafe if not made properly, as they contain flammable parts. Scientists are working to make them safer and more sustainable, exploring new materials and designs.",
