	"summary": "Limestone is a common type of sedimentary rock made mostly of calcium carbonate. It forms over millions of years when minerals like calcite and aragonite precipitate from water, often due to the remains of sea creatures like corals and shells. Limestone is full of fossils, offering clues about ancient life and environments.\n\nIt is very versatile. People use it to make lime for cement, as a base for roads, in toothpaste and paint, and to improve soil. Limestone areas often have unique landscapes called karst, with lots of caves and sinkholes.",
