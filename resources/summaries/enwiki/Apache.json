Some well-known Apache bands include the Chiricahua and Jicarilla. Today, Apache tribes live in parts of the United States (Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and Oklahoma) and Mexico (Sonora, Chihuahua, Coahuila, and Tamaulipas).\n\nHistorically, Apache land included mountains, valleys, canyons, and deserts in the Southwest. They fought against Spanish, Mexican, and U.S. forces for many years, earning a reputation as brave warriors and clever strategists.",
