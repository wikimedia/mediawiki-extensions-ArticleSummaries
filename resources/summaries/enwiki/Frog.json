	"summary": "Frogs are a diverse group of tailless amphibians, with a history dating back at least 250 million years. They live in various habitats, from rainforests to subarctic regions, and are found worldwide. Adult frogs have distinctive features like stout bodies and protruding eyes. They lay eggs in water, which hatch into tadpoles. Frogs are important in ecosystems as both predators and prey.\n\nWhile some species are thriving, many are threatened due to habitat loss, disease, and pollution. Frogs are culturally significant and are also valued as food by some human populations.",
