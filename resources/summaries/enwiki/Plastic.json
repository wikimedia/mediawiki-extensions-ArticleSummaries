	"summary": "Plastics are synthetic materials made from polymers, often derived from fossil fuels like petroleum. They are versatile, lightweight, and cheap to produce, which has led to their widespread use. Common household items made from plastics include packaging, toys, furniture, and pipes.\n\nThe first synthetic plastic, Bakelite, was invented in 1907. Today, there are many types, like polyethylene for packaging and PVC for construction. However, the popularity of plastics has caused environmental issues, as they break down slowly and often end up in landfills or as pollution.",
