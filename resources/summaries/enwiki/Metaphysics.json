	"summary": "Metaphysics is a type of philosophy that looks at the world's most basic parts. It asks questions like, \"What is real?\" and \"What are things made of?\" Some philosophers think it's about understanding how we know things, while others focus on the actual objects in the world.\n\nThis field covers many ideas, such as what exists, how things are grouped, and if things are possible or necessary. It also explores space, time, and how we connect the mind and matter. Philosophers use different methods, like logic and science, to study these big questions. Metaphysics has a long history, starting with ancient thinkers and still being debated today.",
