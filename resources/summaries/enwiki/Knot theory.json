	"summary": "Knot theory is a branch of math that studies knots, like those in shoelaces, but with ends joined so they can't be undone. The simplest knot is a ring, called an \"unknot.\" Mathematicians describe knots using diagrams and try to tell if two knots are the same. They use \"invariants\" â€“ special characteristics that stay the same no matter how the knot is described. Since the 19th century, mathematicians have cataloged over six billion knots. They also study knots in higher dimensions and with different shapes.",
