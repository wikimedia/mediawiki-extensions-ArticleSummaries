The idea comes from Plato's writing, where the demiurge shapes the universe based on perfect forms.\n\nThis concept was adopted by various philosophical schools, with some considering the demiurge as a good creator, while others, like Gnostics, saw it as evil or ignorant due to its link with the physical realm. The word itself means \"craftsman\" and comes from Greek.",
