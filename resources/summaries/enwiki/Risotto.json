	"summary": "Risotto is a popular Italian dish made with rice, cooked in broth until creamy. It often includes butter, onion, wine, and Parmesan cheese. The broth can come from meat, fish, or veggies. Originally, saffron gave risotto its signature yellow color and flavor. In Italy, risotto is usually a first course, but 'risotto alla milanese' is often served with a meat dish as a main course.",
