	"summary": "Kinkiness refers to sexual practices that are not typical or conventional. It's like having a \"twist\" in your sexual behavior, making it different from what most people do. The word \"kink\" is often used by people who have unique sexual interests, like fetishes. These can range from playful activities to more intense practices.\n\nIn simple terms, kinks are things people do in their private lives to make their sexual experiences more exciting or satisfying, beyond what's usually considered normal. Some people group BDSM (which involves dominance and submission), leather fetishes, and similar activities under the \"kink\" umbrella.",
