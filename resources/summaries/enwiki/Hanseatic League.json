	"summary": "## The Hanseatic League: A Medieval Trade Powerhouse\n\nThe Hanseatic League was a powerful group of trading cities in Europe, starting in Germany around the 12th century. It grew to include nearly 200 towns across eight modern countries. Traders formed this league to protect themselves and boost their business. They offered special privileges to members, helping them dominate trade in the North and Baltic Seas.\n\nThe League was very influential, but it had no central government or army. It slowly declined after the 15th century as trade routes changed and members left. It officially ended in 1669. They mainly used ships called cogs for trading, which were replaced by larger ships over time.",
