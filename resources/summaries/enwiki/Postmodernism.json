	"summary": "Postmodernism is an idea that started in the 1950s, changing how we look at art, books, and buildings. It means moving away from old ways of thinking and representing the world. Instead, it's about being playful with different styles and using irony. Some people think it's great for embracing different cultures and ideas, but others criticize it for focusing too much on style and not enough on important values. It questions traditional beliefs, which can make some people see it as negative or confusing.",
