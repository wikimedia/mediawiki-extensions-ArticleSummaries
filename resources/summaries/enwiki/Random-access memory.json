	"summary": "RAM is a type of computer memory that lets you store and access data quickly. It's like a temporary workspace for your computer's brain (CPU). There are two main types: SRAM and DRAM. SRAM is faster but more expensive, while DRAM is commonly used in computers today.\n\nThe first RAM chips were created in the 1960s by IBM and Toshiba. Over time, RAM technology improved, leading to faster and more efficient memory modules, such as the modern SDRAM used in personal computers.",
