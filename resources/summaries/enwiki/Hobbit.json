	"summary": "Hobbits, created by J.R.R. Tolkien, are small, human-like beings about half the average human height. They're known for their hairy feet and living in underground homes. First seen in \"The Hobbit\" and later in \"The Lord of the Rings,\" they play key roles in saving their world, Middle-earth. Hobbits live in towns like Hobbiton and regions like the Shire and Bree-land. Despite some debates about their name and origin, they represent modern humanity, bridging the gap between the modern world and Middle-earth's ancient heroes.",
