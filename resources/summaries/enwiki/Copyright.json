	"summary": "## Copyright in Simple Terms\n\nCopyright is like a special rule that protects creative things people make, like books, songs, or art. It gives the creator the right to decide how their work is used, shared, or changed. This protection lasts for a certain amount of time, usually 50 to 100 years after the creator dies. After that, the work becomes available for everyone to use freely.\n\nCopyright doesn't protect ideas, only the specific way they're expressed.  Think of it like a recipe: the ingredients and method are protected, but anyone can use those ideas to make their own unique dish.",
