	"summary": "The Teutonic Order, started around 1190 in Acre, was a Catholic group that helped Christians visiting the Holy Land and ran hospitals. Known as Teutonic Knights, they fought to support Catholic control in the Holy Land and in Northern Europe during the Middle Ages. They also protected Catholics in Eastern Europe. Today, the Order is mainly religious and gives special honors. A related group, the Bailiwick of Utrecht, is Protestant and also gives knighthoods and does charity work.",
