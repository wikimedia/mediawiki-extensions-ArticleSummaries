	"summary": "Diabetes is a common health problem where your blood sugar stays high. It happens when your body doesn't make enough insulin or doesn't use it well. This can cause symptoms like being very thirsty, peeing a lot, losing weight, and having blurry vision. If not treated, it can lead to serious issues with your heart, eyes, kidneys, and nerves.\n\nThere are two main types: type 1 (treated with insulin shots) and type 2 (often managed with medicine and lifestyle changes). Many people have diabetes, and the number is growing, especially in poorer countries. It's important to get help from a doctor if you think you might have it.",
