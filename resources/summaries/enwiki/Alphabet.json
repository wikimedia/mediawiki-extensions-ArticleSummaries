	"summary": "## Alphabet\n\nAn alphabet is a set of letters that represent sounds in a language. The first alphabet was created in Ancient Egypt to help write hieroglyphs. Later, the Phoenicians developed a fully phonemic script, which became the basis for many modern alphabets like Arabic, Greek, Hebrew, and Latin.\n\nTrue alphabets use letters for both consonants and vowels. Others, like abjads, only use letters for consonants. Alphabets are often arranged in a specific order, making it easy to list words in alphabetical order. Some alphabets, like Greek, have unique names for their letters (acrophony).",
