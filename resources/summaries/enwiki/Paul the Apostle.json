	"summary": "Paul, also known as Saul of Tarsus or Saint Paul, was a Christian apostle who lived around 5-65 AD. He is famous for spreading Jesus' teachings and founding many Christian communities in Asia Minor and Europe. Paul wasn't one of the original twelve apostles and didn't know Jesus during his life. His life and work are mainly described in the New Testament's Acts of the Apostles. Paul had a dramatic conversion experience on the road to Damascus, where he saw a vision of Jesus and was blinded for three days. After this, he started teaching that Jesus was the Jewish messiah. Many of the books in the New Testament are believed to be written by Paul or his followers. His writings are still very important in Christian theology and practice today.",
