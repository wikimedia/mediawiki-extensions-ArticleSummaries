	"summary": "The Hebrew alphabet, with 22 letters, is used to write Hebrew and other Jewish languages. It developed from the Aramaic script, which came from the Phoenician alphabet. Originally, it was an \"abjad,\" meaning it only had consonants. Over time, scribes added vowel points (niqqud) and used certain letters to represent vowels, especially in modern Hebrew. The alphabet is written from right to left and has different styles, including cursive. A modified version is used for Yiddish, where all vowels are spelled out.",
