	"summary": "## Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs)\n\nUTIs are infections in your pee system. They can happen in your bladder (cystitis), urethra (urethritis), or kidneys (pyelonephritis). Symptoms include painful peeing, needing to pee a lot, and feeling like you need to pee even when your bladder is empty. Kidney infections cause fever and side pain, too.\n\nUTIs are usually caused by bacteria, especially E. coli. Women get them more often because of their anatomy. Doctors treat UTIs with antibiotics. Drinking lots of water helps, too.",
