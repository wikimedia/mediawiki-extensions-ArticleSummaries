	"summary": "Nauru, officially the Republic of Nauru, is a small island country in the Pacific Ocean. It's one of the smallest countries in the world, both in size and population. Originally settled by Micronesians, it was later colonized by Germany and then became a League of Nations mandate after World War I, administered by Australia, New Zealand, and the UK. Nauru gained independence in 1968. It's known for its phosphate deposits, which were heavily mined, causing environmental damage. Now, it relies on aid from Australia and has a controversial immigration detention center.",
