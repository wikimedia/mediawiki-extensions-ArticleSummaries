	"summary": "Earth is surrounded by a layer of gases called the atmosphere, which makes our planet look blue from space. This is because blue light is scattered more by the gases. The atmosphere is like a protective shield, providing oxygen for us to breathe and protecting us from harmful space objects and radiation. It's made up mostly of nitrogen and oxygen, with smaller amounts of other gases. The atmosphere's layers include the troposphere (where weather happens) and the stratosphere. Human activities are now changing the atmosphere, affecting the climate and ozone layer.",
