They are born in freshwater rivers, spend their adult lives in the ocean, and return to their birthplace to lay eggs, a cycle called anadromous. Some salmon are landlocked and live only in freshwater. Salmon are important for food and fishing. They are farmed in many places, with Norway producing the most. Salmon are also prized by recreational anglers.",
