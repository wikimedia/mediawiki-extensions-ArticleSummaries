	"summary": "Mexico's drug war is a battle between the government and drug cartels. It started in 2006 when the military tried to stop drug-related violence. The war began after a powerful drug lord, Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo, was arrested in 1989. This led to a fight for control among different cartels. Mexican cartels became stronger after Colombian cartels weakened in the 1990s. They control most of the cocaine coming into the U.S. Many leaders have been arrested, but violence continues as cartels battle for power. The war has caused tens of thousands of deaths since 2006.",
