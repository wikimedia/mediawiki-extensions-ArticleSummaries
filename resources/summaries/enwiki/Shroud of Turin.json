	"summary": "The Shroud of Turin is a piece of linen with a picture of a man, said by some to be Jesus. People have argued about its age and how the image got there. Some think it's a painting, while others believe it's a miracle. Scientists tested it and said it's from the 1300s, not Jesus' time. The Catholic Church doesn't say if it's real or not, but many people still believe in its power. It's kept in a special chapel in Turin, Italy.",
