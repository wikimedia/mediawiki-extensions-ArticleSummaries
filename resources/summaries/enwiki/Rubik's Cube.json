	"summary": "The Rubik's Cube is a popular puzzle invented by Hungarian architect Ern≈ë Rubik in 1974. It's a cube with six coloured faces that can be twisted and turned, mixing up the colours. The goal is to solve the puzzle by turning each face so that it has only one colour. Originally called the Magic Cube, it became a worldwide phenomenon in the 1980s and has sold over 500 million units. People still enjoy solving it today, and there are even competitions for speedcubing (solving the cube as fast as possible).",
