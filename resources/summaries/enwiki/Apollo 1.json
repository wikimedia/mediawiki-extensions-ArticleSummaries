	"summary": "Apollo 1 was the first planned mission in NASA's Apollo program to land a man on the moon. On January 27, 1967, a fire during a test killed all three crew members: Gus Grissom, Ed White, and Roger Chaffee. The fire started due to an electrical issue and spread quickly because of the oxygen-rich environment inside the spacecraft. The tight-fitting door couldn't be opened to rescue them.\n\nAfter the accident, NASA investigated and found problems with the spacecraft's design and emergency preparedness. They also discovered a report criticizing the main contractor, North American Aviation. Apollo missions were paused for 20 months to fix these issues. The first successful crewed mission, Apollo 7, launched in 1968.",
